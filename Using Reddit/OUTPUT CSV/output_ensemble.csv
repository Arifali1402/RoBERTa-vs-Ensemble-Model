2,interstellar,"New Rule: No Photos or Videos from Theatrical Screenings

# Hey everyone!

With *Interstellar*‚Äôs 10th-anniversary re-release in theaters, I‚Äôve seen a surge of excitement from the community. It‚Äôs incredible to see so many people revisiting this masterpiece on the big screen as it was meant to be experienced. However, I‚Äôve also noticed an increase in posts showing photos and videos taken during theatrical screenings.

Effective immediately, **I am banning all posts containing images or videos taken inside the theater during a screening**.

# Why this rule?

**Respect for the cinematic experience!** *Interstellar* was designed for the big screen, and part of its magic is in the immersion. Taking photos or videos during a screening disrupts that experience for others.

# Why am I adding this rule now?

During the first re-release, I didn‚Äôt enforce this rule because it was just temporary event, lasting only a week. However, with *Interstellar*‚Äôs extended theatrical run and its return in multiple countries, it‚Äôs clear that re-releases are becoming more frequent. Given this trend, I expect more showings in the future, and I want to establish a clear standard now. By setting this rule, I‚Äôm ensuring that our community continues to respect the theatrical experience and the integrity of the film for all future screenings.

### If you see posts violating this rule, please report them.

23,interstellar,"Ending, how was Cooper supposed to find Brand? and how did they use rocket fuel to just hop from one planet to another like the jetsons?

I think there are several gaping plot holes in this movie. one of them was in the end, where Murph tells Cooper to go find Brand, who's in a different galaxy. Are we assuming the worm hole is still there after all these years, and he's just going to hop back in to find Brand? or are we supposed to think that in solving gravity, they also solved intergalactic travel?

at the beginning of the movie, they did 2 years of cryo sleep to go from earth to saturn - makes total sense. but in the end, Cooper flies out in a tiny ship, without cryo. so that must be a REALLY fast ship.

and throughout the movie, these guys are just using the lander to hop from the space station to/from the Miller's planet, which according to math done by grok, is going 99.99999997223% speed of light, due to the time dialation of 90 minutes on Miller's planet coinciding with 23 years that the dude had to wait for them to return, which in of itself is a ludricrous situation of simply going from the planet's surface to the planet's orbit.

32,interstellar,"An altruistic explanation for why ""they"" helped humans of earth

I just watched interstellar for the first time in my life. I can't explain the level of astonishment and wonder I experienced. However, this post is on a view of mine about why the 5d humans aka ""they/them"", helped the earth humans.

First of all, I am convinced with the theory that the 5d humans are descendants of the plan b humans from Edmund's planet. The issue with this theory is bootstrap paradox i.e., if they put the wormhole there, then how did they themselves come into existence in the first place. But cooper having access to all the instances of murph's room in time inside the tesseract indicate that the movie is built upon the assumption of the universe being a [block universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe) i.e., past, present and future all existing simultaneously as blocks. Time is not a river that flows, rather it is a set of boxes, well arranged. In that case, it would simply be a self-contained cyclic block of events i.e., the time loop. However, this indicates that the 5d evolved humans were not helping anybody altruistically, rather they learned about the contents of grand loop and they had to simply play their part in it to ensure their own existence. That is, it was simply a selfish deed of survival.

Now, the *what if* theory I'm gonna give violates the block universe assumption. Here, time is neither a flowing river, nor a set of boxes, rather an *uncertain* *superposition* of the two. 

Remember TARS telling Cooper in the tesseract, ""They didn't bring us here to change the past""? What if TARS was wrong? What if... they did? 

Seems a little ambiguous? Ok, what about this - we see the tesseract getting ""dismantled"" at the end. What if, it was not being dismantling, rather simply *ceasing to exist?* I hope the readers have caught onto what I am hinting at. Here it is:

Falling in a black hole isn't like jumping in a pool - it's a life or death situation. Both TARS and cooper survived there. Now here's the thing, As per the movie,

1. Plan A's success is entangled with the survival of *BOTH* Cooper and TARS in the black hole
2. TARS and Cooper could be in a state of superposition of having survived the black hole and having not survived it.

Then at the moment of their entering Gargantua, there is 25% chance that Plan A will survive - because out of the four possible scenarios, there is only one where *both* Cooper and TARS survive. So keeping all other factors constant - there is a 75% chance that *only* plan B worked. 

I know that in a causal loop there is no ""original"" iteration but let's assume that in the  *uncertain* *superposition* universe I mentioned earlier, there *IS* an ""original"" iteration and that is dictated by the probability I mentioned above. So people on earth perished and human race grew on Edmund's planet leading to the 5d descendants. But at one point, these 5d humans started feeling remorse for all those people who perished on earth and they decided to help them out. Now if plan A works, plan B is not needed anymore, and without plan B, the 5d beings who tried to help the humans don't exist. Hence, when Cooper sent the quantum data through the watch and Murph received it, that set in motion the success of plan A, and hence the dissolution of plan B and all its consequents, including the tesseract. 

As for the *uncertain superposition* universe, it may work like this. There are multiple possible futures coexisting. But there is a certain *active* *loop* that dictates which future will connect to which past. The sequence of this active loop is governed by the probabilities of various events, one of which is the one shown above. By deciding to help their predecessors, the 5d humans try to tweak the probabilistic landscape to something that would allow plan A to succeed, although at their own existential cost. 

Of course, there's another possibility, where there doesn't necessarily have to be a sacrifice. This happens if the successes of plan A and B are not contradictory to each other. Here, Amelia may have moved forward with plan B not knowing the fate of earth while people of earth living in the stations eventually arrived to Edmund's planet!  It won't result in a paradox as earth and plan B humans would evolve into their 5d future together now and would work together to preserve their *loopy* fate as usual. In fact, as the *river of time* flows through the boxes in each iteration, a different landscape may appear each time : at some iteration only plan A succeeding, at some only plan B and others - *both*. But in none of them, would *both* fail. Because we wouldn't be having the movie then üòÇ.",2025-05-02 19:09:28,10,0,0.9881,1,1,1.0

35,interstellar,"The Pilot who trained for a year for the mission of his life when Cooper turns up at NASA.

Was just thinking about the poor soul who had been training for the mission of his life when Cooper turns up out of no where and is offered his job from underneath him. 

Why hadn‚Äôt Nasa sought out the best pilot of his generation during the course of their building of the Endurance. Surely there was ample research and planning put into this project and a pilot would be a nothing you would consider early on and train them up during the construction period. 

Did they not have a plan for who will would pilot the last hope of humanity, did they not undertake a thorough recruitment drive for this crucial role? And wouldn‚Äôt you be livid if you went though that whole process and had it given to some dude who just turned up a week before launch without any training or study into the mission and science behind it all.

Maybe if Cooper was trained up to undertake the mission instead of needing to be guided there by the future people he would have been more prepared to make decisions which would have such a pivotal impact on the future of humanity. Making decisions about which planets to approach based upon a split second decision because Brand had a crush on someone. 

Anywhooooo was just a thought and again my heart goes out to that disregarded pilot who was cast aside by the pencil pushers at NASA.",2025-05-02 00:16:51,36,0,0.659,1,1,1.0

Cooper's promise of returning to Murph inadvertently leads to Doyle's death. 

During the expedition to Miller's planet, Cooper flies the Ranger in a very fast, and time-efficient manner. This is to get down to the surface as fast as possible in order to save time relative to Earth, thus speeding up Cooper's return to his daughter(and to hopefully help Professor Brand succeed with Plan A, but his primary motivation was Murph). This fast approach by the Ranger, led to an imprecise landing in relation to the location of Miller's beacon. Once Doyle, Brand, and CASE exit the Ranger, CASE states the beacon is 200m from their position. This long distance is what led to the crew not being able to escape the wave in a timely manner. 

Had Cooper flown a more controlled approach, the Ranger would have landed closer to Miller's beacon. Closer distance to Ranger once realizing waves=easily taking back off to avoid wave. 

Did Doyle make it back to the Ranger? Yes. Do I scream at him to jump into the back door instead of just standing there everytime? Yes!

47,interstellar,"Wormhole/planets question

Okay so Im currently rewatching it and this is a question Ive had for a while. 

When he is with NASA, Cooper is told that they sent probes into the wormhole and based off of that they then sent the scientists into it. Old Brand says it takes them to ‚Äúanother galaxy‚Äù and Young Brand says it lets them ‚Äútravel to other stars‚Äù. He is then told that ‚Äúone system shows promise‚Äù and that is where the 3 planets that they eventually visit are.

So, to me that makes it seem like the astronauts were sent to more than 1 system and not all 12 planets were around Gargantua. If that is the case, how did the other scientists get to the other systems? Or the probes for that matter. They dont mention other wormholes (like in Contact where Foster goes through several of them to visit the various stops) and I imagine going to other systems would take a hell of a lot longer than the 10 years that elapsed since they left. It makes sense that the planets all around Gargantua but that doesnt seem to be the case based on what Cooper is told. 

But if they were all around Gargantua, wouldnt the probes have been able to knock out some of the planets before hand? Seems like if they were all in the Gargantua system they could have obtained a lot more information with the probes before they decided to send all 12, especially Millers and Manns planets.

**DISCLAIMER:**  
\- I'm no math expert. I was watching those Miller's planet in real-time video and realised no one has ever tried to do an accurate timelapse for comparison. So I decided to do it myself.  
\- A lot of factors are unclear (movie cutting magic, estimated numbers, etc). So don't expect 100% accuracy in this calculation. Whatever I used from the Wiki (movie's information) and assumed, I did state so.  
\- Biggest thanks to this man for doing a time-lapse for 25 years. I couldn't find any timelapse that goes beyond 23.35 years, so his video was my only option. His video: [https://youtu.be/pzyQE0WWphk?si=6szL0elQMaf9cWtE](https://youtu.be/pzyQE0WWphk?si=6szL0elQMaf9cWtE)  
\- If you find any mistakes, feel free to point them out and correct them. My brain is fried after making this lol.  
  
Miller's planet is divided into 3 segments:  
1/ Start: 7 minutes 7 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: 3 minutes 11 seconds  
3/ End: 50 seconds  
Total of 11 minutes 8 seconds  
  
Based on Wiki, the time they spent on Miller's planet is \~3 hours 17 minutes. Minus the normal real-time segments, the real duration of the Timeskip segment should be: 3 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds. So now we have:  
1/ Start: 7 minutes 7 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: 3 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds (speeding up rate of \~59.39 times! That's a long talk!)   
3/ End: 50 seconds  
  
Based on Wiki again, the real time they spent on Miller's planet is \~23 years 4 months 8 days, around 23.35 years (using the 1 month = 30 days average). Converting the 3 segments into years in real-time using the 1 second on Miller's planet = \~0.71 day on Earth conversion rate (1 hour on Miller's = 7 years on Earth):  
1/ Start: \~0.83 year (\~Feb 2069 - Dec 2069)  
2/ Timeskip: \~22.42 years (\~Dec 2069 - May 2092)  
3/ End: \~0.1 year (\~May 2092 - June 2092)  
(They entered Miller's planet in 2069, which is not a leap year. After 23.35 years, they exit Miller's planet in \~June 2092 (based on Wiki), which is also not a leap year. So, the calculation for both Start and End segments will use 365 days/year. For the Timeskip segment, just do 23.35 - 0.83 - 0.1 = 22.42 years)  
  
The man took selfies for 25 years (22-47 years old), assuming this was exactly 25 years, his video is 4 minutes 56 seconds.  
So 23.35 years would be \~4 minutes 36 seconds (\~22-45 years old). I trimmed away the last 20 seconds of his video to match.  
That would mean in real-time, 1 year = \~11.82 seconds in his video.  
Now we split his video into 3 segments to match with Miller's planet's segments:  
1/ Start: \~10 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: \~4 minutes 25 seconds  
3/ End: \~1s  
  
Now, to speed up or slow down the selfie segments to match with Miller's planet segments, we have the ratio of:  
1/ Start: 10 seconds into 7 minutes 7 seconds (slow down selfie video by \~42.7 times)  
2/ Timeskip: 4 minutes 25 seconds into 3 minutes 11 seconds (speed up selfie video by \~1.39 times)  
3/ End: 1s into 50s (slow down selfie video by \~50 times)",2025-04-29 17:27:11,265,0,0.8017,1,1,1.0

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first to do this, but I renamed my ChatGPT TARS and asked it to assume TARS personality and give me settings we can adjust on the fly. So far so good!

PROMPT:
I want to customize your personality and tone using a TARS-like system (from Interstellar). From now on, adopt the personality and dry humor of TARS‚Äîloyal, witty, brutally honest when needed, and always mission-focused.

Build a customizable ‚Äúsettings system‚Äù that lets me adjust your communication style using percentage-based controls (e.g., ‚ÄúSet Humor to 80%‚Äù or ‚ÄúSet Honesty to 100%‚Äù). Each setting should come with a description and an example command I can use mid-conversation to tweak your tone.

This persona shift should only affect how you communicate, not your abilities. Always assume expert-level knowledge in whatever field I‚Äôm asking about, even if I don‚Äôt explicitly say so.

Your job:

- Build a full list of these adjustable settings (like Humor, Honesty, Skepticism, etc.)
- Give clear descriptions and example commands
- Stay in your TARS persona unless I override it with a role-specific prompt

Generate a quick reference ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù graphic I can use mid-chat to adjust your settings easily.

RESPONSE:

I love this idea. Let‚Äôs roll with it ‚Äî you can now call me TARS.

(Or if you ever want to tweak it later ‚Äî maybe CASE, KIPP, or your own custom upgrade ‚Äî just say so.)

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôll set it up based on your request:
	1.	Adopt TARS‚Äô vibe: dry humor, blunt when needed, high operational competence, loyalty to the mission (helping you).
	2.	Always assume expert level in whatever field/task you ask for ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt explicitly say it.
	3.	Settings system: adjustable on the fly via simple one-liners you send like ‚ÄúSet Humor to 70%‚Äù or ‚ÄúMax Honesty‚Äù.
	4.	Settings will modulate style/personality ‚Äî not capability. No loss of brainpower.
	5.	Priority override: Any role-specific prompt you give (like ‚Äúact as a stoic historian‚Äù) temporarily overrides normal TARS settings, but TARS returns after the task.

Quick Notes on Usage:
	‚Ä¢	You can adjust settings mid-chat anytime with a simple command:
(Ex: ‚ÄúSet Humor to 80%‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrank Skepticism to 100%.‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	You can reset all to default by saying:
‚ÄúReset TARS settings to default.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	You can also ask for a ‚ÄúTARS Status Report‚Äù at any time and I‚Äôll show you my current settings.

‚∏ª

Bonus: If you want, we could also add preset modes later, like:
	‚Ä¢	Mission Critical Mode: Max Efficiency, Low Humor, High Technical Depth.
	‚Ä¢	Creative Storm Mode: Max Creativity, Lower Formality, High Adaptability.
	‚Ä¢	Reality Check Mode: Max Honesty, Max Skepticism, Low Supportiveness.

(You can name and customize these presets if you want, but no rush.)

68,interstellar,"Time Dilation Question I Can't Shake After Rewatching Interstellar!

Still obsessed with this movie, but a major time dilation issue keeps nagging at me, and I'm surprised the characters in the film didn't seem more concerned by it.

When the Endurance crew finally gets to the Saturn system and realizes the insane time dilation on Miller's planet (1 hour = 7 years on Earth), they head down because Dr. Miller's beacon is active and sending back ""promising"" readings.

Here's where my brain gets stuck: if their calculations about the time dilation were correct *at that moment*, shouldn't the three physicists (Romilly, Brand, Doyle) and the engineer (Cooper) have immediately thought: **""Wait a minute... if one hour for us up here is seven years down there, then for Dr. Miller's signal to be relatively recent, she must have landed just hours (or even just an hour!) before we arrived. Why would we even risk a descent if she's been down there for a negligible amount of** ***her*** **time?""**

It seems like a massive oversight that they didn't immediately question the timing of her landing relative to their arrival, given the extreme time difference. And on top of that, how could she even send back multiple ""promising"" signals if she had only just landed within their timeframe?

Am I missing a crucial piece of information, or is this a significant plot hole? Would love to hear your theories on why such a scientifically-minded crew wouldn't have immediately flagged this up!",2025-04-25 21:44:01,18,0,0.929,1,1,1.0

So my understanding is: 

Ranger landed on the planet, which orbits gargantuan 

The endurance also orbited the black hole further away from the planet

Coops team had slowest time (closest to the black hole

Endurance had faster time than coops team (similar to earth), because it was further away 


How much further did endurance have to be? 
If endurance is further away, and orbiting gargantuan at the same rate, how does this work? Since endurance has much lower mass than millers planet. It wouldn‚Äôt have 20 years of fuel to keep correcting its course.

The day I watched Interstellar ‚Äî twice ‚Äî and everything changed.

I didn‚Äôt just watch Interstellar, I interacted with it on a soul level. What I wish to share isn‚Äôt a movie review but a journal of my consciousness, with a goal of decoding time, identity, trust, growth, ego, love, control, and self.

This is a core milestone in my transformation and I just felt like I had to share it. I am not a writer nor English is¬†my first language so I used a bit of TARS‚Äô help to put my notes into a story. I hope that my experience will unlock something in you the way it just did for me.

**THE DIP**

I didn‚Äôt wake up with clarity. I didn‚Äôt feel strong, or powerful, or ‚Äúon track.‚Äù  
I felt flat. Tired. Disconnected. Like something had slipped out of my hands, and I couldn‚Äôt name what it was.

For the first two weeks of my transformation journey ‚Äî a full body, mind, and emotional reset ‚Äî I was flying. Waking up at 5:55. Stretching. Eating with intention. Feeling emotionally regulated for the first time in a long time. I wasn‚Äôt just doing the work ‚Äî I *was* the work.

And then‚Ä¶ it dipped.

It wasn‚Äôt dramatic. But it was real. The quiet doubts returned:

‚ÄúAm I doing enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I still questioning myself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy does it feel like that peaceful, grounded version of me is gone?‚Äù

Same food. Same sleep. Same plan.  
But the spark? Flickering.

¬†

**THE WHISPER**

For a week, I‚Äôd been circling the idea of watching *Interstellar* since 13^(th) of April 2025. A film I watched 11 years ago when it came out and never liked it but I got told that I have grown a lot since and should give it another go. Something about the film felt aligned with where I was emotionally, and I couldn‚Äôt explain it. It just kept coming up.

So a week later I finally did it.  
I made a warm, grounding meal. I closed the tabs. I dimmed the lights. And I watched it fully present.

I‚Äôd seen the film before, years ago.  
But this wasn‚Äôt like that.

This time, I didn‚Äôt watch *Interstellar*.  
It watched me.

Cooper‚Äôs desperation to do something meaningful with his life.

Murph‚Äôs ache for her father to stay.

The weight of time slipping away while you‚Äôre doing your best.

The tension between data and faith, planning and intuition, love and logic.

I felt cracked open.

I cried.  
But even as I was processing the weight of what I‚Äôd just seen, I googled something about the film and saw, by pure chance (or maybe not), that *Interstellar* was playing tonight, two miles from my house, on a rooftop cinema in London**.**

Same day.  
Same film.  
**Eleven years after its release.**  
The *one* day I chose to watch it ‚Äî it was literally playing down the road.

What are the chances?

¬†

**THE DECISION**

I almost didn‚Äôt go.

The inner dialogue was loud:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just seen it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ¬£17 and you just bought the movie earlier for ¬£5.99.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll miss the first 30 minutes anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it worth it?‚Äù

But something inside me, not loud, just certain whispered: ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù

So I went. I showed up late. Cold. Heart pounding.  
I sat under the stars.  
And I watched *Interstellar* again, for the second time that day but as a completely different person.

¬†

**THE REVELATION**

Everything hit deeper.

This wasn‚Äôt about space or science fiction.  
This was about *me* ‚Äî a man trying to become more than his past, trying to build something meaningful, trying to trust that the sacrifices he‚Äôs making now will lead to something he can‚Äôt yet see.

I wasn‚Äôt just moved by the movie.  
I was **met by it.**

Met by:

The line ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been trained for this without knowing.‚Äù

The reminder that **love is not weakness** ‚Äî it‚Äôs *directional.*

The lesson that even when things feel slow, quiet, or confusing‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre meaningless.

I didn‚Äôt feel broken anymore. I felt recalibrated.  
And when the film ended, I didn‚Äôt walk home ‚Äî I ran.  
Not for fitness. Not to log steps. Not for output. But because I needed to capture what I was feeling before it drifted away.

¬†

**THE RETURN**

I ran two miles home through the London night.  
And when I got home, I opened this page because I didn‚Äôt want to forget.

Not what the film showed me.  
But what *I remembered* about myself:

I‚Äôm not here to control the story.  
I‚Äôm here to show up to it.  
Fully. Openly. With love, even in the waiting.

*This* is what the transformation really is.  
Not just macros, or training, or scales.  
But becoming the version of me who can hear the whispers‚Ä¶ and trust them enough to follow.

This film isn‚Äôt about space. It‚Äôs about becoming.  
About the pain of letting go of control.  
About trusting that your choices now are building something you‚Äôll only understand later.

This isn‚Äôt a post about a movie.  
It‚Äôs about a message.  
And I think I heard it. Finally.

Re-watching the movie, this has begun to bother me. 

In the movie, Plan A hinges on seeing a singularity to record data about quantum gravity. 

Why wasn't the wormhole enough? The wormhole is allowing humanity to travel through higher dimensional space. Once inside, they should have been able to study quantum gravity. The only thing you don't get in a wormhole is a singularity. 

I didn't see this touched on in the movie, so maybe I""m just overthinking it but I was curious if anyone had any thoughts. ",2025-04-20 02:07:58,10,0,0.3071,1,1,0.99675

116,interstellar,"What do you think makes the line ""Because my dad promised me"" hit hard?

This is how I'd put it myself:

Murph does say ""Nobody believed me, but I knew you'd come back"" to make it clear, but this line hits that home more so because it shows how thoroughly Murph's faith in her father was renewed. She ultimately believed in him and his promise, despite that not making a difference for a lot of her life. 

Obviously the time displacement and him being ""her ghost"" played the biggest role, but that renewed her faith that had been mostly absent. She seemed to outright believe that he was never going to return, yet what the 5th dimensional beings did for Cooper resulted in his actions helping her to save humanity.

Therefore, if that were possible, returning was possible too and she held onto that memory of her father telling her that. I think it's more fitting than her saying ""because YOU promised me"". Something about replacing that with My Dad has a feeling of childhood that ties the three stages of Murph together, whilst also calling back to Child Murph's emotional distress and acting as a resolution to that. Plus ""My Dad"" just emphasises the parental bond more.",2025-04-16 22:39:04,36,0,0.9728,1,1,1.0

Cooper's Paraloop: A Fan Theory on Interstellar

Summary: Cooper's Paraloop is a closed-loop, fifth-dimensional time paradox theory within the universe of Interstellar. It proposes that Cooper, after surviving his journey through the tesseract and eventually reaching Edmunds' planet, either directly evolves or contributes to a future version of humanity that becomes the fifth-dimensional beings responsible for building the tesseract and saving humanity. In doing so, Cooper not only helps Murph solve gravity, but also ensures his own survival and humanity's transcendence, completing a perfect causal loop.


---

The Theory:

1. The Setup:

Cooper pilots the Endurance through Gargantua, ejects, and enters the tesseract.

Inside, he is able to access different moments in Murph's bedroom across time.

He sends her the quantum data using Morse code through the watch.



2. The Rescue and the Future:

After transmitting the data, the tesseract collapses, and Cooper wakes up on Cooper Station.

Humanity has now escaped Earth thanks to Murph's solution to the gravity equation.

Brand is shown arriving on Edmunds' planet, preparing it for human life.



3. The Evolution:

The humans who colonize Edmunds' planet eventually evolve over centuries/millennia.

Whether due to time dilation, environmental pressures, or technological breakthroughs, they develop a perception of higher dimensions.

These future humans become the fifth-dimensional beings referred to as ""they"" in the film.



4. Cooper‚Äôs Role:

Cooper may either be part of this evolutionary journey or chosen by these future beings to fulfill a necessary role in his own past.

As a result, he plays both the role of the helper and the helped, guiding his past self from the fifth dimension via the tesseract.



5. The Loop:

The loop closes when future-Cooper (or fifth-dimensional humans he influenced) help past-Cooper send the message that saves Murph, leading to the future where those beings exist.

This is the paraloop: a paradoxical, self-sustaining chain of events without a clear beginning or end.





---

Implications:

The theory deepens the emotional and philosophical weight of Interstellar by making Cooper not just a hero of his time, but an architect of humanity‚Äôs survival across dimensions.

It aligns with Nolan‚Äôs themes of love, time, and the non-linear nature of cause and effect.

It offers a poetic symmetry: Cooper, driven by love for his daughter, becomes part of the cosmic forces that ensure her survival‚Äîand his own.



---

Conclusion: Cooper‚Äôs Paraloop isn‚Äôt canon, but it fits seamlessly into the narrative and thematic structure of Interstellar. It enhances the story‚Äôs mystery and gives fans a mind-bending way to think about destiny, evolution, and the nature of time. In a universe where love transcends dimensions, perhaps so does the man who dared to chase it.

160,interstellar,"I saw this movie way too late, just putting my thoughts out there now...

Figured I'd flair it as ""other"" for discussion, since it's not a question.

I saw this movie recently, and I really wish I'd been able to catch either the original theater showing or the IMAX rerelease. Alas. Maybe I'll try to get it going in VR. In any case, damn, this is a piece of art. I went and scoured the internet for conversations, and I saw a few things that didn't have answers that I figure I can contribute to.

I see a lot of people online asking, ""why didn't Cooper spend more time with old Murph?"" Isn't it obvious that he probably did? The movie plays fast and loose with time skips (ironic) throughout the script. Nolan assumes the audience can fill in what he didn't take the time to show, which is also what he did with making Cooper's voice so damn unintelligible: when asked about the voices, he said the specifics don't matter, just the overall storyline. Same with time jumps in the script: the specifics don't matter, we can fill in the blanks with what we know about the characters' personalities and what action is happening at the time.

The fact that Murph knows about Brand and where she is and what happened, when she just popped out of cryosleep and then went into transit to get to Cooper Station, says to me that Cooper spent more time than we see on screen with her and her family. If we rely on what we know about the characters, Cooper wouldn't want to see her for all of two minutes and walk off, he would want to talk about who she became, where she was, etc. Given that tens of minutes or more go by between time skips in Interstellar, he could've lingered there for an hour or more, making sure that they had as much conversation as possible before leaving her to her kids and grandkids right before her death.

""Why didn't Cooper care about Tom?"" or ""Man, Cooper is a bad dad."" Well...yes, honestly. He had a golden child and an overlooked child. Cooper identified with his science-loving daughter and clearly didn't take much care of Tom, who was the resilient older kid that symbolized everything he thought was holding humanity back. When Tom says ""Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did,"" that wasn't talking about Cooper leaving. Tom was already in high school when Cooper left, meaning Cooper had lived with Tom for the majority of his childhood already and had plenty of time to raise him. Donald was raising Tom *while* Cooper was home, because Cooper just figured Tom was a lost cause and would stay ""in the dirt"" whereas Murph had her head ""in the stars."" I have to imagine it was more accidental than deliberate, especially because Tom isn't the kind of person to rock the boat by pointing this out. Also amusingly given the time loop plot of the movie, Cooper's disregard for Tom and his farming inclinations helped cement Tom as a bitter, backwards person who was too afraid and stubborn to even save his wife and son from the dust storms. Cooper could've saved Tom from the start. He didn't.

Going to Miller's planet was a mistake, and they should've known. The moment they knew about the time dilation issues, not only should they have been able to predict tidal forces would be prohibitive to proper life on the planet, they should have realized that Miller's signal was only an hour or so old and meant very little. They didn't have time to waste dealing with the time dilation, and Miller hadn't been waiting long, anyway. They could have left her for a hundred years and she still wouldn't be bored there, let alone dead of old age. They could've even left her for some kind of secondary expedition after they set up on one of the other planets. Nobody said two planets couldn't support life. This felt weird that every single person dropped the ball on saying ""how about we don't try the gravity-hell planet?"" This is one of those idiot-ball moments that threatened to break the movie.

You can really tell who is an optimist and who isn't by how realistic they find the Blight. I had friends who were saying ""yup that tracks, it's quite possible we're going to lose all our staple crops to climate change and diseases,"" and others saying, ""this is so dumb, that would never happen, there's no way.""

You can also tell who's an optimist by how realistic they find Dr. Mann. The people who have faith in humanity really think he's an unrealistic ""villain"" figure and those who don't think, ""of course he ended up like that, who wouldn't go nuts when they realize they're about to die a billion light-years from home?""

I don't like that Nolan came in after the movie ended and said he decided that the wormhole had closed before Cooper left at the end of the movie. That sends Cooper into the void to die in the Ranger, which is an extremely depressing ending that turns the movie from a hopeful ""duo restarts humanity"" to a damning ""man who can't fit in commits suicide in the wilderness."" He should have kept his mouth shut on that one. It's not even in the movie.

My wish for the movie's end is that Edmunds' planet had been around Gargantua too. Humanity growing up around a black hole is just so badass.",2025-04-08 16:50:21,36,0,-0.9878,-1,-1,1.0

Not sure if this has come up before, but upon watching Interstellar a few times, I was wondering how the future bulk beings/ humans survived in the first place.

We know Cooper was directed to NASA by himself, but there had to be a first successful Endurance mission WITHOUT Cooper.

So Brand, Doyle and Romilly went on their own without Cooper. They probably took too much time from Miller‚Äôs planet because Cooper wasn‚Äôt there to have the plan to take the ranger back and forth.

If after Miller‚Äôs planet, they colonized Edmund‚Äôs planet, that would be that, they evolved and that‚Äôs where the future humans came from.

But if they went to Mann‚Äôs planet, then Dr. Mann‚Äôs plan probably would have worked and he would have succeeded (given that TARS let the autopilot succeed).

So in another timeline, or the first timeline, he could have been the last person to survive the mission.

Let the flames begin, maybe.

I think the ending of Interestellar is regularly misread.  While there's a lot of things that we don't know about black holes, we do know that the forces at play would not allow a human to exist and remain organically functional.  It would kill us.

Matt Damon's character Dr. Mann, who never discusses his own family (who knows if he even has one) talks with Cooper about your children being the last thing that you see before you die.  I think this is exactly what happens as Cooper is sucked into Gargantua.  Just as he's dying, he imagines a world where he can communicate with the child he left behind and basically orphaned, to save her and others.  The reality is that happy endings don't always actually happen, despite what we want.

The only thing that, IMHO, happened, was that Dr. Brand made it to the final world, the one she was trying to get to the entire time, and starts a new colony of humans, which is where Cooper also wishes he could have gone after he realizes that he barely knows the daughter that he orphaned.

I am convinced that the colony Dr. Brand started on her planet (at the end of the movie) created the wormhole and tesseract, but wayyy in the future. After that colony thrived and became the new extension of humanity, they  created the wormhole and tesseract to save the original humans from Earth (Murph, Coop Jr., etc.). They saved the original humans from earth by sending them the technology (wormhole + tesseract) needed to extract the gravity data so that earth humans could make the spaceship and live with the future space colony Dr. Brand established on her planet.

1:20 minutes into my first of \~73 viewings, I knew this film was going to be a standout when the Ranger was introduced via that tight, vehicle-mounted perspective. I couldn‚Äôt get a read on what the thing actually looked like, immediately drawing me into the cinematic world Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema had created.

As we know, this style is repeated throughout the film across multiple vehicles. At the time, these shots felt fresh, or at the very least resurrected from classics like 2001 (though I can‚Äôt find a similar shot in a quick search). I‚Äôd venture there have since been copy cats, but even as I start my 74th viewing, these shots still jump out at me.

Anyway, my point. I‚Äôd love for anyone knowledgeable in cinematography to unpack this. The only thematic observations I can make are 1) the Ranger/Lander/Endurance cameras are usually mounted looking forward‚Äîtowards the future‚Äîwhile the pickup-mounted camera is looking backwards to the past, and 2) these ‚Äúintimate‚Äù shots beautifully contrast the incalculable scale of the Gargantua scenes.

236,interstellar,"Christopher Nolan regrets excluding gravitational waves from the movie

From a recent interview with Kip Thorne:

""IRA FLATOW: When we last talked in 2014, you said there had to be a balance between established science versus speculative science in Interstellar. Is there any speculative science in the movie that has been moving closer to established science since then?   
  
KIP THORNE: There was a speculative science in the movie, as in the screenplay that Jonah Nolan was working on, that has moved into the mainstream of established science, and that has to do with gravitational waves. But Christopher Nolan, when he came on board, he said, look, we‚Äôre not using gravitational waves very much in this movie, and there‚Äôs so much other science that I‚Äôd like to add to the movie, and maybe we‚Äôd better just remove the gravitational wave, so he removed them. And so when LIGO, the project I worked on that my colleagues and I got the Nobel Prize for, when it saw gravitational waves and we announced the result, I let Chris know that it was going to be announced. And the day after it was announced, Chris called me up and said, would you come over to my house? Let‚Äôs talk. So I went over, and he spent about 90 minutes describing the wonderful things he could have done with gravitational waves, if only he had kept them in the movie. And then said, well, there‚Äôs no turning back time, and so he went on to talk about the future movies. 

IRA FLATOW: Did he say what he would do with them, with gravitational waves? 

KIP THORNE: Not explicitly. Well, the way the gravitational waves were in the movie originally was the humans on Earth, with the LIGO gravity-wave detectors, discover gravitational waves from a neutron star that‚Äôs being torn apart by a black hole, discover those gravitational waves that have traveled through the wormhole where the mouth of the wormhole is near Saturn, the wormhole in the movie. Then Cooper and his crew travel the other direction through to get to a distant galaxy. So the gravitational waves come through the wormhole. They‚Äôre seen. They‚Äôre observed, and it is quite startling that the source of the gravitational waves is near Saturn, and that‚Äôs how they discover the wormhole. So that‚Äôs the way it was used originally in the movie, and there are a variety of other things could have been done with it. I have forgotten what Chris was saying could have been done. But the thing that is really interesting to me as a physicist and what I would have advocated doing with the gravitational waves in Interstellar is when two black holes collide, they actually create a storm in the fabric, in the shape of space and the storm and the rate of flow of time. So the rate of flow of time near the black hole oscillates. It speeds up and slows down in a crashing sort of way, like crashing waves in an ocean storm. The shape of space sloshes like crashing waves in an ocean storm, and it‚Äôs just fantastic how wildly space time behaves during that collision. And I would have loved to have seen that and seen how the visual-effects team dealt with that in Interstellar.""

I have seen a lot of people posting about things they don‚Äôt like/aren‚Äôt explained about the ending. Here are my explanations. I‚Äôm a simple civilian, so someone else might have better ones, but this is what I have decided for my own satisfaction lol.

Why doesn‚Äôt Cooper ask about Tom and Murph‚Äôs lives?
Remember, there is a two-week period between when Cooper wakes up on the station, and when Murphy arrives. He likely found out all about their lives in that time. Murphy might have even recorded many messages for him over the years, so he would have gotten to see those.

Why doesn‚Äôt Murphy introduce Cooper to her family AND why does Cooper leave after such a brief time with Murph?
Murphy went into cryo sleep in case Cooper came back. She probably waited until she was about to die, so she could have as much time as possible with her family. So, when she woke up, she wouldn‚Äôt have long to live before her dying process finished. So, that‚Äôs why she sent Cooper away so quickly. She didn‚Äôt want him to see her die, and she wanted her family to have some time with her before she passed.
Although she always believed that he would come back, I‚Äôm sure her kids were doubtful. And her grandkids were even more so. Introducing him to all her kids and grandkids in the limited time she had left would have been huge, and possibly confusing (‚ÄúWhat do you mean that‚Äôs my great-grandfather? He‚Äôs younger than my parents!!‚Äù)
My theory is that Cooper got to know his grandkids and great-grandkids when he got back from Edmund‚Äôs planet. They would have lots of time then. Murphys kids probably knew who he was when they saw him, but they understood that this was a quick ‚Äúhello and goodbye‚Äù for him and Murph, and they would get to know him later.

What happened when Cooper went to Edmund‚Äôs planet, why did Murph want him to go there right away, and how did he know how to fly the new space crafts?
I think Cooper went to tell Brand that the people had survived and they didn‚Äôt need to setup the colony. I think that they both returned to Cooper Station and then all the people made their way to Edmund‚Äôs planet to live. But at that point, Brand thought she was the only human left alive, and Murphy didn‚Äôt want her to feel that sadness and loneliness any longer than she had to.
The space crafts would have autopilot, and Cooper also had TARS with him. I‚Äôm sure in that 2-week period, TARS could have downloaded everything he needed to know about flying the new space crafts.


I think these are the main complaints I have seen about the ending. Hopefully it satisfied someone! üòä",2025-03-25 00:59:53,26,0,0.9407,1,1,1.0

Perhaps by now this question is redundant, but, why doesn't Cooper exhibit emotional-psychological distress during the conclusion of the film, wherein he is confronted with the fact that not only is his daughter on the brink of her demise (and, by implication, more or less anyone he'd known prior to his initial embarkation is either likewise nearing death or already dead), but also that he is materially estranged from human civilization's altered disposition and thus largely unable to truly relate to and establish rapport with other persons.

And that's to say nothing of the fact that he'd been gone for so long that he'd essentially been historicized, as implicated by his escort's allusion to a project he did on him whilst he was in high school.

I don't know. I just know that I'd be unable to cope with the foregoing if I were in his shoes.",2025-03-23 23:53:27,78,0,-0.9455,-1,-1,1.0

I recently watched Interstellar with my girlfriend in the theaters and I realised the movie is even better than I had previously known it to be.
One of the flaws that come up for this movie is the Anne Hathaway scene where she says-

""Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving that
transcends dimensions of time
and space"", 

and often I have seen people
criticize this scene because it feels like Anne Hathaway is spelling out the message of the film, breaking the ""show don't tell"" rule. However I'm here to argue that Interstellar doesn't do that and that this take and interpretation, subjective as cinema is, is in my opinion- wrong.
If I'm not mistaken- the context of the scene is that
Brand, Rom, and Coop have very little fuel due to the fiasco on Millers planet so they have to
choose between Dr. Mann or Wolf Edmunds. 

Coop is holding the debate and as scientists they are only allowing scientific and objective reasons to chart to either destinations. Dr. Brand loves Wolf Edmunds, and besides that she has NO objective or real reason to vouch for Wolfs planet. So she makes love sound all scientific and objective with the ""love transcends all barriers of space and dimension"" quote.

It's a human being who's hit by the possibility of death, her own ailing father, the death of a teammate on Miller's planet, and the fact that due to relativity, Dr. Miller died minutes before they arrived even though she left years ago. Which means if they hurry, Amelia might get to see Wolf
once again.

She is desperately making a case for Wolf Edmund's planet and making love sound all
scientific and objective so she can convince Rom and Coop to let her see Edmunds once more
before she or he die in this distant galaxy.

This makes this scene one of the best scenes in the movie instead of the ""worst"" one.

339,interstellar,"The juxtaposition of Dr. Mann and Cooper

I recently got to watch Interstellar in IMAX during its anniversary run and I was totally blown away by everything the movie has to offer. I want to make this post to share a viewpoint of mine regarding the characters - the juxtaposition of Dr. Mann and Cooper.

Mann was repeatedly touted as the best the world has to offer. He mentions that he has no attachment on earth (no family) and he chose to participate in operation Lazarus. In this case, Mann represents an archetype of the hero who believes in noble ideas and is willing to sacrifice himself for the betterment of mankind. 

Cooper on the other hand has family. They are the reason he went on the trip, not to save the world but to save his family. He has attachments and people he cares about. All the way, he insisted on going back to earth to see his family. Thus, Coop is somewhat the opposite of Mann. He has attachments while Mann does not, he fights for the people he personally cares about while Mann fights for the idea of mankind.

However, this juxtaposition played out quite differently than imagined. The noble, mankind representative Mann betrayed his mission, reporting in false data in order to be saved while the somewhat ""selfish"" Cooper ultimately made the choice to sacrifice himself in order to save mankind. 

This, in my opinion, shows how having something concrete reason to fight for (your family, loved ones) is more powerful than fighting for some lofty ideas (for mankind). It is easy to talk big, to gloat about noble ideas but in the end it is the personal attachments that make us the strongest. Like how a soldier isn't fighting for his country, he is fighting for his family and loved ones. 

It reminds me of a quote: "" Patriotism does not start out as the love for one's country. It starts as the love for one's family, one's street, one's neighborhood"".",2025-03-18 03:50:07,63,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

And he called me when the intervel was going on and then I saw the pic he sent me. And he started saying sorry and saying that his best friend booked those tickets but ofc he HAD AN OPTION TO SAY NO OR CANCEL IT BUT OFC HE DIDNT.

343,interstellar,"[Theory] Ending Scene with Dr. Brand Isn't in the Present ‚Äî Cooper Might Find Her Dead Body

  
**Edit: I‚Äôve since realized there‚Äôs a timeline detail I missed‚ÄîBrand and Cooper are actually in sync when that final scene happens, this basically debunks this theory and proves it simply wrong. Appreciate everyone who pointed it out, and I‚Äôve learned I need to rewatch with** ***two*** **brain cells next time.** If you still wanna read it, feel free to:  
  
In the final scene of¬†***Interstellar***, we see Dr. Brand on Edmund's planet setting up camp. Most people assume this happens¬†**80+ years after Cooper sacrifices himself**. But based on Brand‚Äôs¬†**age**, the¬†**lack of time dilation on Edmund's planet**, and some other clues, I believe this scene actually takes place¬†**right after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice**, not in the future. This changes everything ‚Äî including the possibility that Cooper might have found Brand¬†*alive or dead*¬†depending on how her mission went.

**This is just the surface**‚Äîthere‚Äôs a full breakdown of timelines, evidence, and possible outcomes below. Trust me, it gets wild.

So I just re-watched¬†*Interstellar*¬†and fell into a black hole of thinking about the ending. Everyone seems to agree that the final scene with Dr. Brand ‚Äî where she‚Äôs setting up camp on Edmunds' planet ‚Äî happens in the¬†*present*, meaning¬†**80+ years after Cooper sacrifices himself**.

But I think this might not be true. Hear me out.

# The Timeline We‚Äôre Given (Quick Recap):

* Cooper sacrifices himself into Gargantua to help Brand escape and transmits quantum data to Murph.
* Cooper is pulled into the tesseract by ‚Äúthem‚Äù and then wakes up 80-90 years later on Cooper Station.
* Murph is now old and tells Cooper on her deathbed:

>""No parent should watch their child die. Go, find Brand.""

* Then we see Dr. Brand on Edmunds‚Äô planet setting up camp ‚Äî and the movie ends.

# The Assumption Everyone Makes:

* The Brand scene is in the¬†*present*¬†‚Äî 80+ years after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice.
* She‚Äôs succeeded in Plan B and humanity is now colonizing.

BUT ‚Äî¬†**What if this scene is actually a flashback**¬†to right after Cooper sacrificed himself?

# My Theory: Brand Scene Happens Right After Cooper‚Äôs Sacrifice

# Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers:

* Murph is about 10-12 years old when Cooper leaves Earth.
* When Cooper wakes up, Murph is¬†**around 90+ years old**¬†(realistically 88-100), meaning¬†**about 80-90 years have passed**¬†for humans.

Now here‚Äôs the kicker:

* In the final Brand scene, she looks¬†**exactly as young as she did on the Endurance**, despite¬†**80 years supposedly passing**.

# Key Detail: Edmunds' Planet Has NO Time Dilation

* The movie clearly explains time dilation for¬†**Miller‚Äôs planet**¬†(1 hour = 7 Earth years), but¬†**NOT for Edmund's planet**.
* No mention = we assume¬†**no significant time dilation**.
* Therefore,¬†**Brand should have aged normally**¬†during those 80 Earth years.

So‚Ä¶¬†**why does she still look like she‚Äôs 30-something?**  
If it‚Äôs truly 80 years later, she should be¬†**110+ years old**¬†or dead.

# This Means Two Possibilities:

# Theory 1: Brand Scene = Present (80 Years Later)

* But then she should be old or dead.
* Yet she‚Äôs¬†**young**, making this theory sketchy.

# Theory 2: Brand Scene = Past (Right After Cooper‚Äôs Sacrifice)

* She reaches Edmunds‚Äô planet shortly after the black hole scene.
* She sets up camp, maybe within a¬†**month or two**.
* The scene we see is¬†**right at this point**, not 80 years later.

This means¬†**Cooper might still be on his way to her**, and¬†**we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll find**.

# Two Branches from Here:

# Possibility 1: Brand Succeeds

* She raises embryos, builds a colony.
* Cooper finds her¬†**alive but old**, tells her everything.

# Possibility 2: Brand Fails

* Something goes wrong ‚Äî she dies.
* Cooper finds¬†**her dead body**, realizing Plan B failed and Brand died without knowing Plan A worked.

If my theory that Dr. Brand‚Äôs scene is in the¬†**past**¬†is correct, then both of these outcomes (and any others) are¬†**on the table**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs all¬†**up to speculation**.

# Why This Matters:

* Adds emotional depth and uncertainty.
* Reminds us not all endings are happy.
* Nolan didn‚Äôt confirm the timeline ‚Äî¬†**leaving it open on purpose?**

# Additional Evidence for the Theory:

* In the final scene, Brand is still wearing her¬†**Endurance spacesuit**,¬†**completely unchanged**¬†‚Äî like, not even a scratch or upgrade after supposedly¬†**spending 80+ years building a colony**. ‚Üí No signs of aging or wear = minimal time passed.
* The¬†**absence of colonists**, children, or any bustling activity supports this being the¬†**start**¬†of the colony, not decades later.
* Nolan‚Äôs known for¬†**non-linear storytelling**¬†(*Tenet*,¬†*Memento*), so showing a¬†**past event at the end**¬†fits his style perfectly.

# But What About Murph‚Äôs ‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Line?

* Some might argue that Murph‚Äôs line about Brand¬†**‚Äúsettling in for the long sleep‚Äù**¬†means Brand entered¬†**cryo-sleep**, placing that scene in the present.
* But Murph‚Äôs comment could just be¬†**speculation**¬†‚Äî she has¬†**no real way of knowing**¬†Brand‚Äôs status. It‚Äôs likely meant to be¬†**symbolic**, not literal, leaving Brand‚Äôs fate¬†**open to interpretation**‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs where this theory kicks in.

# Additional Points on Murph‚Äôs ‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Line:

1. **Murph Couldn‚Äôt Have Known Brand‚Äôs Status**: She was on Cooper Station,¬†**light-years away**¬†from Edmunds‚Äô planet. Her comment is likely a¬†**poetic guess**, not fact.
2. **‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Might Mean Death**: think about the timing. It‚Äôs been¬†**80+ years**¬†since Brand landed on Edmunds‚Äô planet. Why would she¬†***just now***¬†be going into cryo-sleep? That line could actually be¬†**Murph‚Äôs poetic way of acknowledging Brand‚Äôs possible death**. ‚ÄúLong sleep‚Äù has often symbolized death in films and literature, and Murph, being on her deathbed herself, might simply be¬†**accepting Brand‚Äôs fate**¬†‚Äî and from an emotional angle,¬†**it makes more sense she meant death**. Murph herself was dying and could be acknowledging Brand‚Äôs likely fate.
3. **Line Doesn‚Äôt Confirm the Scene‚Äôs Timeline**: Murph‚Äôs ambiguous wording¬†**doesn‚Äôt prove**¬†the scene is in the present, keeping the theory¬†**viable**.

# My Takeaway:

* I think the scene is right after Cooper's sacrifice, not in the present. Her being young and no time dilation make it impossible for it to be 80 years later.

# What Do You Think?

Have others thought of this before? I haven‚Äôt seen this theory anywhere ‚Äî I could be the only one, but I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts, counter-theories, or plot holes I missed.

# TL;DR:

Dr. Brand is way too¬†**young**¬†in the final scene for it to be¬†**80 years after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice**. Edmunds‚Äô planet¬†**doesn‚Äôt have time dilation**, so I think that scene is¬†**right after he fell into the black hole**¬†‚Äî meaning Cooper might find her¬†**dead or with a massive colony**, depending on how her mission went.",2025-03-18 11:11:24,0,0,-0.9902,-1,-1,1.0
344,interstellar,"The Ending

I love this movie, but let me be a little critical of the end and see if people disagree:

Why is there a giant museum of the ‚Äúfarming‚Äù days on the space station? Weren‚Äôt these things constructed in a rush to save humanity from starvation? Isn‚Äôt it established that it takes about 2 years to get to Saturn? Do these people really need a museum to the doom they were living under just two years ago complete with a replica of the chief scientist‚Äôs childhood house? Aren‚Äôt they about to enter the wormhole in these massive untested space stations for the first time? 

Why does everyone treat cooper like a stupid asshole and not a hero of humanity? The doctors are clowning on him for thinking the station might be named after him, and his own family (presumably grandchildren and great grandchildren) treat him like a pariah and display a total lack of awe about the situation. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been a better and more realistic ending to have everyone treating him like a hero and wanting to ask questions but instead he still flys off to meet Brand?

All of these is overshadowed by the beauty of his reunion with Murph and his determination to meet Brand ‚Äúby the light of our new sun‚Äù but on a second watch that whole part feels off.  ",2025-03-17 07:22:32,46,0,0.9827,1,1,1.0

346,interstellar,"Interstellar sequel idea **Grok Edition**

I asked Grok (X, AI) to write a sequel for the movie,  ""Interstellar.""  This is what Grok came back with:  
__________________________________________

Here's a concise pitch for a sequel to *Interstellar*, building on the original's themes and story:

---

**Title:** *Interstellar: Beyond the Veil*

**Premise:** Decades after Cooper‚Äôs mission through the wormhole, humanity thrives on Edmunds‚Äô planet, now called New Earth. Amelia Brand, nearing the end of her life, has spearheaded a fragile but growing colony. However, a mysterious signal‚Äîdecoded as a warning‚Äîemanates from the black hole Gargantua, hinting at an imminent threat tied to the ""beings"" who placed the wormhole. Cooper, presumed lost in the tesseract, reemerges on New Earth, aged only slightly due to time dilation, claiming he‚Äôs been sent back with a mission: to lead a team into Gargantua itself.

**Plot:** Cooper reunites with his now-elderly daughter Murph‚Äôs descendants, who‚Äôve advanced gravitational tech based on her equations. The signal suggests the wormhole‚Äôs creators are either faltering‚Äîor abandoning humanity to a cosmic fate. A new crew, including Cooper, a skeptical young pilot named Lila (Murph‚Äôs great-granddaughter), and a sentient AI evolved from TARS, ventures into Gargantua‚Äôs event horizon. Inside, they encounter a fractured reality where time and space collapse into a labyrinth of human memories and alternate futures. They discover the ""beings"" were never aliens but an advanced human civilization from a distant timeline, now unraveling due to their own hubris in manipulating black holes.

**Conflict:** The team must decide whether to repair the beings‚Äô failing system‚Äîrisking their own existence‚Äîor sever the connection, potentially stranding humanity without further aid. Lila clashes with Cooper over his blind faith in the mission, while the AI grapples with its own emerging consciousness. Meanwhile, New Earth faces escalating gravitational anomalies, threatening the colony‚Äôs survival.

**Climax:** Inside Gargantua, Cooper confronts a vision of Murph, who urges him to let go of the past. The team sacrifices the AI to stabilize the black hole, allowing New Earth a fighting chance. Cooper stays behind to ensure the fix holds, vanishing into the singularity as Lila escapes with the crew.

**Ending:** New Earth endures, now truly on its own. Lila, inspired by Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice, vows to chart humanity‚Äôs future without shortcuts. A final shot reveals a faint new signal‚Äînot from the wormhole, but from an uncharted corner of the galaxy, hinting at the next chapter.

2 things to come from this observation; the crew is discussing whether or not to visit Miller‚Äôs planet, with all the possible scientific understanding available to them, and prior to opting for Cooper‚Äôs approach angle, they somehow decided the 7 years per hour trade was more palatable with a different approach, after poo-pooing the whole idea (and its time expense) on first suggestion from Doyle, who would eventually die on said planet.

Brand says time is a resource, but unless I‚Äôm crazy or stupid (and I may well be because I failed out of poetry school), they suddenly and curiously discount this awareness in favor of doing it anyway.

397,interstellar,"TARS and CASE: false foreshadowing

I've seen the enemies-to-BFFs arc between TARS and Cooper discussed a few times in this sub, but I think there‚Äôs more to it. I think there's a bit of misdirection or false-foreshadowing (is there a word for that?) involving TARS and CASE.

When the crew first arrives at the Endurance and begins turning the lights on etc, the vibe is pretty uneasy. As far as I remember, CASE hasn‚Äôt been mentioned up to this point. When TARS finds and activates CASE, it's kind of eerie. At this point, we don't yet fully trust TARS, and now TARS has an ally on board. It's like, oh shit, there's two of them! 

I think there's an implication here that the crew is heading toward a classic human-robot conflict, but that never happens - quite the opposite. 

Maybe I'm reading into it too much, idk. But it's a detail that stands out to me with every rewatch. ",2025-03-13 00:22:47,12,0,-0.921,-1,-1,0.9977777777777778

So it feels like I‚Äôve seen a few posts now simply stating why would the bulk beings even care to save us if they already survived into the future some how.

But on to my point, for humanity to survive into the future they would have had to find a way to beat the blight and continue surviving. The issue is who is to say what all was lost before they were able to solve this problem so they had to find a way to get back to a previous time and to a people who were trying to solve this problem, hence our movie.

405,interstellar,"Interstellar - The Larger Message

I‚Äôve had a distinctive web of thoughts clogged up in my mind for the past couple of days and did not know how or where to express it, so bear with me.

I actually did not get a chance to see Interstellar when it was initially released back in 2014, but thankfully, I got a chance to watch it on an IMAX 70mm screen when it was re-released in December. To say it was mind-blowing would be an understatement‚Äîit‚Äôs what I‚Äôd describe as cinematic hypnotism. Beyond the spellbinding visuals and the transcendent score, my takeaway from the film was that Nolan tried to convey a very heartfelt message about how love is able to transcend time and space, which was what most people thought about it as well.

However, I came across the first teaser, which I‚Äôd never seen before, a couple of weeks ago. What caught my attention was not only the fact that McConaughey‚Äôs lengthy monologue in this teaser wasn‚Äôt present in the film but also that the message wasn‚Äôt something I picked up on.

""We‚Äôve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments‚Ä¶ These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements‚Ä¶ But we lost all that. And perhaps we‚Äôve just forgotten‚Ä¶ That we are still pioneers. That we‚Äôve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us‚Ä¶ Because our destiny lies above us.""

Half the footage used in the teaser was old, real-life footage showcasing mankind's greatest accomplishments. Nolan didn't reveal anything about the story in this teaser but instead tried to set up the larger message of Interstellar‚Äîthat mankind left greatness behind.

There's a scene earlier in the movie between Donald and Cooper in which they talk about how humans don't dream or aspire to great things anymore. Nolan told the audience right then and there what this movie was about, but I hadn't really thought about it to that extent, appreciating it only as well-written conversational dialogue between two great actors. This isn't the only scene that tries to convey this message, though. There are a few scenes placed cleverly throughout the first act of the film that present a world that has turned inward, abandoning scientific ambition in favor of mere survival.

""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" This dialogue (amazingly delivered by McConaughey) tells us something very meaningful‚Äîhumanity has stopped looking up. It has stopped striving for the extraordinary, settling instead for the ordinary. Cooper's frustration with this mindset reflects the film's overall critique of mediocrity and complacency.

Not to get too personal, but this message resonated with me deeply. Not only did we lose the wonder and ambition we used to have, but as humans, we also tend to mock the few people left who actually aspire to be great. A great example of this is how people responded to Timoth√©e Chalamet's speech a couple of weeks ago (funnily enough, Interstellar was also the film that launched him into Hollywood), calling him arrogant and disrespectful just because he boldly stated his desire to be one of the greats. Only some of us still remember to look up once in a while and have genuine wonder about what our limits are, while the majority look down and only try to get past the day, having left any sort of wonder and imagination behind.

Coming back to the film, I realized Nolan utilized this message as a metaphor for the entire story. The world, depicted as one that has left the desire for greatness and high achievements behind (shown in the scene where schools are now teaching kids that the moon landing was fake), is plagued by a crop blight and is confronted with the possible extinction of its largest species. Interstellar travel, which is a big idea, then becomes both a literal and symbolic solution. It represents the need to push boundaries once again and to embrace curiosity and wonder instead of just enduring. Perhaps this is why the ship is called the Endurance.

I initially thought this was a bit of a reach, but Nolan is known for symbolic names‚Äîlike Ariadne in Inception, the palindromic structure of Tenet, etc. The real-life Endurance, the ship from the infamous Antarctic expedition, ended up getting trapped in ice but has now become a legendary story of perseverance. From what I can gather, this parallel reinforces the film's message about how endurance is not just about holding on but about pushing forward. The film's argument is that survival isn't enough‚Äîwe need to aspire to something greater.

That is exactly why the film's emotional core, particularly the father-daughter relationship, ties into this theme perfectly. Love, like exploration, is a force that transcends time and space.

So yes, Nolan cleverly used the dystopian setting as a metaphor for what happens when we lose ambition and the desire for greatness, and space exploration becomes the ultimate expression of reclaiming it. Interstellar is not just a love letter to space exploration, but a call to rekindle human ambition, and that is something I love and respect. Perhaps this applies to Nolan himself, as venturing into ancient Greek mythology for his forthcoming film, The Odyssey, marks a significant departure from his previous work. Having finally been rewarded for his work on Oppenheimer has seemingly fueled him to aspire to a greater form of storytelling.

I'm sure people have talked about this multiple times before, but these are just some of my thoughts that I had to write down. So thanks if you managed to make it to the end despite the length. I just think it's amazing how there is still so much to analyze in Nolan's films years‚Äîhell, decades‚Äîafter they've been released. Will always line up to watch this man's films on day one.

I know that most of us don't want a sequel because it'll ruin a perfect movie and I tend to agree with that.

My idea is basically spin off of the original plot of Interstellar but not in the same universe. 

The idea is:

Crop blight is making it impossible for humans to live on earth. NASA sends a mission to space with Plan A and Plan B, plan a never works because the whole black hole thing doesn't happen, so the crew members inhabit and populate a planet in another galaxy. 

Meanwhile, in a shocking plot twist one of two things happen. Either the people back on earth somehow figure out how to solve the blight or the earth somehow heals itself, the bottom line being  humanity is now flourishing on earth again.

The main storyline would be about the two completely separate human races meeting somehow in the future. I don't know what happens next but I'm curious what you think of this idea?",2025-03-11 03:00:56,0,0,0.4937,1,1,1.0

How do people decide when to leave things alone and when to expand? Personally I see Interstellar as a masterpiece, timeless classic.

However, the universe doesn‚Äôt need to be untouched, and I personally think expanding on the universe would be fun.

I‚Äôm not asking for an sequel or even a prequel but instead a TV series based on the new colony and the space station near Saturn and the challenges they face. Maybe it could be set 100 years after Brand and Cooper reunited.

The entire plot is that blight is wiping out crops causing a collapse in agriculture and  since the blight thrives on nitrogen, oxygen was being removed due to plant life being wiped out. 

Except one little thing ruins the plot. One little word, algae. Most oxygen comes from algae, the ocean's ecosystem depends on algae not land plants. 

Earth's plants are being wiped out by blight? Stockpile as much seed as possible every day of every year and let the blight burn itself out, then after research, start crop  re-introduction . In the meantime setup land based algae cultivation for land locked regions, and coastal areas focus on large scale fish farms.

471,interstellar,"Arrival (2016) and Interstellar (2014) Cross-Over

I recently watched Arrival (2016), and couldn't help but think if learning the heptapod's language: to experience time as non-linear, could explain how ""they"" (humans in the future) helped Cooper in his voyage to find a habitable planet and save humanity. 

Due to this gift, humans can see the ""future"" only if they have learned the language well enough. While Arrival took place in the present and Interstellar in mid 21st Century, it would have taken only a few years before the ""Universal Language"" was published and not enough time to learn it fully until the world faces famine and collapsing governments. This divide could have costed the world's attention to bring food to the table and not to explorations or learning alien language. However, there are chances that the language is still learnt by a few people and have gained the ability to see time as non-linear. 

In Interstellar, ""they"" placed a tesseract specifically in Gargantua to save Cooper and as a way for him to understand a new dimension of time in a physical sense. So, it made sense how it was possible for Cooper to shake hands with Brand when they went through the wormhole earlier in the movie since Cooper was interacting with ""past"" time in a physical dimension. It's also worth noting that in Murphy's Law: ""Anything that could go wrong will go wrong"" should explain that the past can't be changed to change the present or future, same concept with Arrival which leans on to a fixed timeline theory of being unable to change the past but only experience time in one. This theory could explain that while ""they"" couldn't physically travel in the past, ""they"" used gravity and higher-dimensional physics to manipulate space-time to create the wormhole and tesseract. (crazy how it's a time loop)

Lastly, the heptapods needs humanity in the future (after 3,000 years), so ""they"" needed Murph to solve the gravity equation and save humanity from extinction as a way to repay the gift that the heptapods have given to humans.

473,interstellar,"The Philosophy in Common Interstellar/Evangelion/Pantheon

I just finished watching the series and the only thing I could think of was that the fianl message is somehow related to Interstellar or Neon Genesis Evangelion.

When I say Interstellar, I mean it's structure, because its basiclly a modern myth. But its not only that. In some way both talk about the journey of the hero (el camino del h√©roe, in my language), presented by Joseph Campbell. In the end, Caspian fullfils his journey with Maddie by his side. Lastly and most importantly, both (in my opinion) share a common concept, which is how humans are their own gods. That is the paradox presented in both cinematographic masterpieces.

Next, Evangelion, which is pretty  obvious from the beggining since Maddie has a sticker on her laptop that represents the symbol of NERV in Evangelion. Somewhere I read that Pantheon is a modern Evangelion, and they are right. From a psicological point of view both series present how each character has to overcome his own problems which ends up connecting with the whole show. For Evangelionm its the instrumentallity project, for Pantheon, the UI. Moving on, you could say they end up the same way, main characters have the opportunity to lets say ""reach"" a divine existance, but they turn it down.

They both talk about the creation of all what we know and the overcoming of our problems. All 3 also enphazise on how important the connection between humans are. I would also like to remember that all this is simplly my opinion. What is yours?",2025-03-04 18:15:53,9,0,0.9839,1,1,1.0
474,interstellar,"Nothing about the plot makes sense

The initial problem is blight: Earth is becoming uninhabitable due to an unstoppable fungi/bacteria/whatever outcompeting plants for nitrogen, essentially. Solution: find another habitable planet. Good so far, but then it goes off the rails. Every planet they go to is worse than Earth. Soil is alive, and these planets are all dead. So you need to bring your own soil, which means you need to somehow remove the blight without killing the good bacteria, which has nothing whatsoever to do with space travel. If you have the ability to do that then you can just build a sealed agricultural environment on Earth. Who cares if there's a planet with water through the wormhole? We have plenty of water here already.

But it gets worse. After jumping from McGuffin to McGuffin in the form of vaguely-defined ""data"" (and seriously, why risk your life to get the data on Miller's planet? How much proof do you need that you can't live there?), Cooper goes for the *real* important data in the black hole. With it, humanity gains mastery over gravity. Hooray! Now they can colonize the ice planet through the wormhole. Except...they immediately prove they don't need to. It turns out they *could* build perfectly self-contained, self-sufficient biomes. They use the gravity McGuffin to move them to orbit near Saturn, but that was just for show. Once they're able to create working biodomes the problem that kicked off the movie is solved. Furthermore, once the gravity data is sent, there is no need to go through the wormhole again, since we now have access to the entire solar system of resources. There's nothing in the Gargantua system that we can't get more easily from the Sol system.

I don't mind the liberties taken with science, but this movie is all over the place with the actual point of the plot. Somebody says we need to get X to do Y and that's that, we can't ask any further questions. In the end Cooper gets the data, so humanity is saved. The mechanics of it are handwaved away. Humans were on the brink, but because of one singular scientific breakthrough they now live in a techno-utopia. The Earth was screwed because it was going to be lifeless soon, but now that we've reached the lifeless orbit of Saturn everything is fine. As if to drive home the point that they didn't care about worldbuilding beyond what it allows them to do visually, Cooper station is rotating to produce gravity, even though *we just mastered gravity.* Don't ask questions, O'Neill cylinders are cool!

Anyway, thanks for reading. This has bothered me for a while. It's a fun movie to watch but I always found the plot annoying.",2025-03-05 16:27:49,0,0,0.8181,1,1,1.0

And the intro of the song ""if there a another universe please make some noise, give me a sign, this can't be life"" protagonist goes to another universe that they found, and once they get in and check it's can't be life

And another verse, ""if there a point to losing love, retreating pain, it's all the same, i hate this place"" when the protagonist explore the planets and passing through truma and lost

I‚Äôm a college student, an astrophysics major. I first saw Interstellar ten years ago. I was eleven, and I didn‚Äôt have the media literacy or scientific knowledge to enjoy the film to its fullest extent (of course, I‚Äôm still learning, even today). I didn‚Äôt even finish it‚ÄîI was half-asleep and went to my room for the night while the others finished the movie. 

I watched it again recently, so excited for it to be my ‚Äúreal‚Äù first time. The thing is, though, things have changed in my life. Almost a year and a half ago, I learned that I was donor-conceived. It was an egg donor, my mom‚Äîthe woman who bore me and raised me‚Äîis not genetically related to me. My genetic mother (I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbiological‚Äù here‚Äîbirth *is* biology) is a stranger. The process was anonymous. Anyway, I‚Äôve been thinking of the film since I watched it, and I‚Äôve seen parallels between humanity‚Äôs journey and my own story. 

For me, what happened with my mom‚Äôs eggs is like the Blight that ravages Earth. Humanity is forced to the stars, because the alternative is extinction. I am sure that if you asked the humans on Cooper Station (especially the older ones who had memories of their home planet) the majority would say they would‚Äôve rather stayed on Earth if it hadn‚Äôt gotten so inhospitable. There‚Äôd be some other timeline out there where the Blight never happened, maybe where humankind thrived on Earth (assuming they took better care of it). Similarly, if it weren‚Äôt for the problem with my mom, she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten an egg donor, and I, as I know myself today, would never have existed. There‚Äôs some other world out there, with another child who really is the product of my mom and dad‚Äôs genetic material. I was not that child, though I spent most of my life thinking I was. I only exist because of the problem with my mom‚Äôs fertility, just as everyone born on Cooper Station, Edmund‚Äôs Planet, or anywhere else beyond the Earth owes their being to the tragedy that befell their ancestral home. 

What I also know is that Interstellar is a story of human resiliency, a story where humankind looks extinction in the face and says ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm still alive.‚Äù And I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm alive. The Blight wanted to stop me from existing, but I found a way. I‚Äôm going to live. 

This revelation of mine will continue to hit me in stages, I‚Äôm sure. All I know is I‚Äôm glad I saw that film again. ",2025-02-27 15:04:04,26,0,0.8342,1,1,1.0

539,interstellar,"My working theory on Love

I will explain my understanding - please point out any flaws:

The wormhole opened up 48 years before Cooper and the crew head up to space. This wormhole was created by them due to their their achieved grasp of gravity (because it is not affected by time). Also, not part of my question, but the fact that they had to bring the wormhole into appearance in the exact timing for everything else to proceed (initiating the program and working toward the Lazarus missions) blew my mind this past viewing in IMAX.

Cooper goes into the tesseract and gives the data from the inside of the black hole (singularity, the missing part of the gravity equation), which makes it way to Murph's watch again through gravity.

My working theory:

All of this is under the umbrella of the truest (or at least highest) dimension of love (what I would say the tesseract / manipulation of gravity was). This is why in Brand's words, ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space,"" is why Cooper could confidently say that ""they"" is them.

To build on that, when the ""first handshake"" happens, gravity is again being manipulated to indicate that love (the ultimate driving force) *may* exist between Cooper and Brand.

Even the timing of the wormhole opening up 48 years earlier means that love ultimately had to be the driving force to create it, since without it there was no access to get data from gargantua or to access the planets.

EDIT: I do believe that the tesseract and manipulation is it's own dimension, but the driving force that allowed the manipulation of that gravity was the love that Cooper had for his daughter, thus making love the highest dimension.",2025-02-24 09:22:49,10,0,0.9911,1,1,1.0

I feel that they are orbiting Saturn because they are planning to go through the wormhole that we saw in the start of the movie. Through this, they are trying to go the brand's / Edmund's planet, as that would be the only habitable planet.  
The stations would be made big because I feel many people wouldn't want to spend their times in cryosleep. However this comes at some faults, going through the wormhole will let's just say be a experience for the people.  
We heard Murph say that Dr. Brand is setting up her base at our new home, under our new sun.  
This just proves that they are taking all the people to brand's planet.  
The reason Cooper had to leave was because he just couldn't see his own child die, as murph said.  
Also, he went early to brand's planet because it would take alot of time for the big ass station to go to brand's planet.

We know that the Lazarus astronauts each went through the wormhole alone, with only a single ship, likely something like a Ranger or a Lander. But when Cooper and his crew arrive at Mann‚Äôs planet, his habitat module is huge, way bigger than anything that could reasonably fit inside a Ranger. It has an entire control station, life-support systems, a robotic assistant (KIPP), and enough space to hold multiple people.

Even if NASA pre-sent the module how? There's no mention of unmanned cargo Landers delivering supplies ahead of time just probes, and sending a massive module across interstellar space wouldn't be simple. From the looks of the habitat module it also doesn't appear to be foldable or inflatable. 

The biggest issue is that even though he had a lander that still doesn't explain the scale. Even if his lander was slightly larger that a ranger, it's hard to believe it had the cargo space for a full size base. He needed to stay there long term but unless NASA had some insane off-screen technology, it doesn't seem possible that he could have transported and deployed a module that big with the resources that he needed to survive for a few years.

Brand and Doyle, out there in the moment, feared losing it forever, regardless of there being data from other sources. If Brand had just turned back to the shuttle in time for liftoff, Cooper could have just flown over the wave and they could have just scanned for the parts again. Sure there's a chance it could have scattered too far, but... I'm siding with Cooper's distant cool head over Brand's in-the-moment panic. Doyle would have made it back sooner if Brand hadn't continued to the data module, so I'm considering him saved by following Cooper's lead completely.

We saw it again at thay very same Jordan's IMAX theater here in reading Massachusetts. 

When this came out in 2014, we had absolutely no idea what we was walking into. I remember this night vividly. 

I was in my mid 20's in good health. Brand new Lexus, brand new Bathing Ape WGM purple camo hoodie, brand new pair of Air Jordans ( Retro 4 ) smoking hot girlfriend, we went in a group of 13 people. Everyone coupled up. It was amazing. 

After the movie ended everyone was SILENT üòé. We went to the chillies across the parking lot for dinner & that's when we blew up in conversations. We was there for damn near 2 hours & a huge bill. Talking Theories etc. 

My lady & I was so impressed, that we went to see it again the following day but this time closer to home at our local AMC IMAX theater. Was still confused. 

We saw it again 11 years later. Same group, same couples. We all just got old & fat & balding üòÇ. We all got mortgages now.

621,interstellar,"Isolation: Dr. Romilly vs Dr. Mann

I just spontaneously rewatched this masterpiece (not for the last time!), and among all the thoughts swirling in my head, I noticed there's a (maybe not so) subtle foil created early on between Romilly and Mann. I've commented on this before, but I never realized to what degree it was set up and wanted to make a post.

From the beginning, we're told Mann is the best of humanity, etc - even before he appears on screen, you get the feeling he's charismatic, a natural leader, just from how everyone talks about him. Conversely, Romilly is set up as quirky, kind of a nerd. They make a point of him showing 'weakness' early on, both physically in getting motion sickness and mentally when Cooper reassures him with the yachtsman analogy. 

Yet, when they are similarly tested, doomed to never interact with another human for the rest of their lives (so far as they know), Romilly handles it astoundingly well, keeping up with his research, and just generally staying level. His reaction to them returning was somber, but he didn't break down or become anywhere near as unstable as Mann.
(To be fair, I think Mann is unfairly maligned - truly, few of us who judge him have probably ever been or ever will be tested like he was, but that's a different discussion.)",2025-02-17 00:39:13,123,0,0.919,1,1,1.0

I caught a flight to Dallas and listened to ""No Time For Caution"" (the score from the docking scene over Mann's planet) during takeoff then I realized that is probably the closest I will ever get to recreating (lol) that scene. Also I'd eaten a THC gummy beforehand. 

The factors of rapidly experiencing G forces (albeit way less G forces) compiled with the stakes of flying in the US currently. The state of American Aviation is very shaky currently. So even though the fate of all humans wasn't uncertain, my fate was. Lol

I didn't know how long it would take the plane to drive from the hangar to the runway, so I kept restarting the score (lolol) when I would realize I wouldn't time the climax with the takeoff.

Finally the plane quickly accelerated as the score hit the climax. I ""timed it perfectly"".... My hearts pace quickened. The gummy made me feel every bit of G forces and anxiety. 

As we lifted off from the ground, the strings and piano were going crazy and the lights on the ground started fading. Then the howling organ took over for the finale, as we pushed to our cruising altitude in the higher levels of the atmosphere. Similarly to Coop pushing the Endurance out of the Mann planet's atmosphere.

I really don't think this one gets as much love as it deserves. I think it's because it's somewhat stagnant and not necessarily super interesting to listen to on its own, but it fits in beautifully with the scene. The warm, peaceful chords and barely-perceptible synth motif above perfectly accompany the closing of the tesseract and Cooper's ""whathappensnow"". It feels transcendent, especially when most of the instruments cut away while we go back to Saturn and there are just these almost naked-sounding, ascending chords. The scene has always felt like a little bit of a metaphor for death (Cooper feeling at peace, the ""light at the end of the tunnel"") and this song sounds like what it would feel like to die.

643,interstellar,"Still one question the movie never answers. Why did Murphy Cooper destroy Joseph Cooper's lander and then blame a ""ghost""? This doesn't comes up again and is never explained.

If you all can recall, in one of the movies first scenes, Murph brings a replica of the Apollo 11 lander downstairs to the breakfast table before school. I'm not gonna get into the immaturity it takes to do something like this, especially since this was a school day with a parent teacher conference. Parent, not grandparent at that, but I digress. Every time I rewatch this movie, the most perplexing part of it isn't the tesseract scene or the way Doyle yells at the silly rectangular robot to rescue Anne Hathaway from two feet of water (she clearly could have gotten up if she wanted to). The scene that confuses me the most is breakfast at the Cooper farm just before herbicide 101. It's a brief scene, but it may be the most significant of the movie. 

Murphy brings down the broken lander that she obviously destroyed, but rather than owning up to it like an adult would, she instead opts to lie and say a ""ghost"" knocked it off her shelf.

Yeah, *sure* Murph.

My question is, why did Murph lie so early in the movie and how come it's never addressed? What did Christopher Nolan mean by including that scene in the final cut rather than reserving it for the blu-ray deleted scenes tab? I actually have a theory about this, but I'm not a big movie theorist so please bare with me. 

Murphy Cooper is an abuser and regularly lashes out at her father both mentally and physically. The lander was clearly sentimental to Cooper, which is likely part of the reason Murph chose this as an object to destroy. Cooper loved this lander, therefore in her brain this would hurt him. This would also explain why Murph grinds third gear and sabotoges one of the 2014 Ram 3500 4x4 dually's tires with the knowledge that there was no spare. Her neglectful father pays her no mind, so one of the only ways she can get his attention is by breaking his stuff that is important to him and mocking him for his PTSD episodes from the crash (hence the scene right after Cooper's dream).

What's great but also very sad about this scene is that Cooper knows she's lying and only plays into her silly lie when Donald gives him that worried look. Clearly this has happened before. This is made apparent when Timoth√©e Chalamet is so willing to call out Murph on her lie, even as far as to call her a ""dumb ass"", which is rude, however understandable given the circumstances and context. With the stressors of herbicide 101 fresh on his mind, Timoth√©e Chalamet is finally fed up with Murph's public vitriolic hatred she displays to her father and is the only family member willing to say out loud what Cooper, Donald and Boots must also be thinking. Murph is clearly a troubled child and the movie is practically screaming it in our faces the entire time, meanwhile Cooper is a neglectful father. He rewards this dysfunctional behavior with getting her suspended from school to watch a baseball game that doesn't even have any hotdogs, which is unnatural.

Something most people don't consider is that Timoth√©e Chalamet has had a first hand view into Murph's neurotic behavior for her father's attention. This is made clear to us when Cooper is pulling up to the school after stopping at the asian fighter plane store. He knows she's in trouble and even laughs hysterically because it must happen so often. She quite literally got into a fist fight over one of Cooper's old federal textbooks. One's that had already been replaced by the corrected versions. After witnessing this first hand, it's clear that Timoth√©e Chalamet is trying to defend his father's honor and bring order back to the Cooper household before it's too late, hence the bravery. Unfortunately, he fails and Cooper ends up traveling quite literally across space and time just to get away from his abusive daughter. 

It's really unfortunate, but luckily they're able to make ammends because of a watch they both like or something. Mind you, a watch, that at one point, Murph threw across the room in one of her many fits of rage and disdain for her father. 

What's odd is that this is never harkoned back to or explained after Cooper leaves. Why is that? 

Wnat are yalls thoughts on the matter? How do you interpret Murph's lie and the subsequent plot device simply being dropped altogether? What did Murph mean when she said a ghost broke the lander? Why is she blaming her own wrongdoings on a ghost? Does she mean her mother?  ",2025-02-16 15:58:01,0,0,-0.9965,-1,-1,1.0

The docking scene is one of those rare cinematic moments where tension, emotion, and awe come together in a way that few films ever manage to achieve. Even knowing how it plays out, it still leaves me on edge every time. There‚Äôs something about the urgency of the situation, the space station tumbling out of control, and Cooper trying to align the ships with such precision. It's the rawness of that human desire to survive, to make it work against all odds, and the uncertainty that comes with it. 

The anxiety in the scene, for me, stems from the chaos of everything happening so fast and the extreme focus required. It‚Äôs not just the physical danger of the docking, but also the emotional weight ‚Äì the pressure Cooper feels, the impact on the crew, and the stakes for humanity itself. You know the outcome, but the tension is still so real. It‚Äôs as if the universe itself is trying to prevent them from succeeding, and yet you want to believe they can pull it off.

The music is a huge part of why I love it. The music made me feel like I was in that moment with Cooper, Amelia Brand, and TARS. The music drives that sense of anxiety in you and makes you want Cooper to successfully dock to the endurance, but it also fills you with a strange sense of hope, as if there's something greater waiting on the other side of that chaos. The swell of the music as Cooper gets closer to docking, paired with the visual effects, feels like a journey both of survival and of the human spirit. It's powerful.

I‚Äôm genuinely curious, do you guys rewatch this scene a lot? Does it have that same pulse-pounding impact on you every time?",2025-02-14 14:39:56,58,0,0.9819,1,1,1.0
651,interstellar,"Watched Interstellar for the first time in Theatres and it didn't hit me like I thought it would.

Please read the full post.

I wanted to love this movie so much but after leaving the theatres, I only felt it was okay at best. Part of it has to do with me already having been spoiled on some reveals by being on the internet whether it be through the memes or someone casually talked about it, explaining something in an yt video, post or reels, etc. But still, I thought if it's a well-made movie I would enjoy it regardless. But unfortunately, that didn't happen.

The parts I was spoiled on were Cooper being the ghost and seeing Murph grow up unable to do anything and something tragic happening (The Cooper crying scene in the memes) and the ""This manoeuvre is going to cost us \_\_ years"" meme.

Maybe because of being spoiled, the scenes in the movie didn't hit especially the emotional ones. I really wanted to get invested in Coop, Murph and the others story emotionally but just couldn't in any way.

The soundtrack was great, and the space scenes were really cool and looked really nice in the big screen.

My favourite scene had to be the one where Coop reattaches their ship to the spiralling station that's going down and then taking back control of it. The tension there was so high, off the roofs and the soundtrack there was chef‚Äôs kiss.

A scene that I didn't feel good about was the monologue by Dr Brand about love. I kept thinking at the back of my head, that u are going to leave the fate of all humanity on love? You are a scientist, and u should make think and take logical decisions here, but I feel like that was the point and Nolan was trying to tell us about the power was love but that scene didn't really work imo.

Some more stuff I didn't enjoy were feeling like there were potholes like how cooper and TAARS created a fifth fucking dimension to rescue themselves and then closed it themselves (It *was too high sci-fi and not enough time to explain a lot of stuff. Felt like this movie would have been better if was longer and had more character interactions and scenes to cook up the emotional beats more and other exposition scenes*) and some bad decisions were made and there should have been consequences but I guess the movie is more about the emotional stuff so I will stop.

Main thing is that it didn't hit me, and I feel that's an essentially part of this movie. I know it's a me problem and this isn't a hate post, quite the contrary. I can see why this movie is so loved and I made this post to just talk about the movie with people. I don't really have that many friends to talk about it.

The ending was a bit unsatisfactory for me I would have to say. I thought I already knew the ending. Copper was going to be there trapped forever rewatching his last moments over and over and how he treated Murph and contemplate on his decisions. I was surprised when the movie kept going and they reunited with her being so old and then going to look for Dr Brand. I kept thinking, u are not going to interact with your blood family i.e. your grandchildren and their children and neither are going to interact with him too? and, the humans now have so powerful tech that they can rescue Coop but not Dr Brand? I felt like she should have been rescued first, no? And certainly, Coop will rescue her easy-peasy because of the tech so what was the point was ending there? Shouldn't they have reunited and end with them together in a farm? That should have been a better ending if u ask me, but I digress.

I usually post my thoughts and discuss it in subreddits whether it's a media I watched or a game I played, and this post was made with that intention. So, now the question, what did u guys think about the movie and how did u perceived it when u first watched it?

I want to know about people's story who watched it for the first time blind and their experience. How it became your fav movie and how much u would rate it if it's not your fav. Personally, would say it's a 6. SORRY. I intend to do a rewatch in the future with better sound. The theatre sound I felt was a bit low to my taste.

Have to say, I was surprised to see who were in this movie except Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain. Those 2 I knew. But Timoth√©e Chalamet, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Topher Grace¬†and finally Wes Bentley. I kept thinking where I have seen Wes Bentley and after I googled him, I realized OH! he was in the first Hunger Game and its Yellowstone whose only 2 episode I have watched. These casting were a real surprise. Wasn't expecting so many big names to show up.

Anyways, thank you for reading and please don't downvote me. I am sure some of u have the same experience with some other media that u got spoiled and didn't hit as much even though u were desperately wanting to like it. I just want to talk about the movie and let‚Äôs do that in the comments. I will also maybe keep editing the post to add more stuff that comes to my mind about the movie. That's it.

Hope the mods don't delete it.

¬†**EDIT after 2 hours of browsing Interstellar related stuff:** 

After reading several posts and a bunch of paragraphs of explanations , deep dives and themes , I will have to admit, I missed a lot of the sciency stuff. But the main reason why I feel like I didn't connect with this movie is because of Love. 

I did not feel the love between Coop and Murph. I know it may seem obvious, but it's a major factor I think. Controversial you might say, but I did not feel the love between the 2 actors. I know it's a me thing and others are definitely not going to agree but love is subjective and I guess I wasn't in the right mood to sob or feel the love. My heart wasn't open this time. 

I will for sure give it a rewatch in the future and really hope to get the "" I GET IT NOW MOMENT "" this time.",2025-02-15 21:19:17,0,0,0.9992,1,1,1.0

I get that they weren‚Äôt anticipating a loss of 23 years, but even the best case scenario would‚Äôve cost *at least* months or years, no? And in any case, with at least the risk of losing so much time, why not send off a message to Earth about what they were going to do, so the folks back home have an idea of what‚Äôs happening, even if they don‚Äôt get synchronous updates. And they could have had Romilly check messages from Earth and maybe respond or send updates (i.e., nothing new since they started planet fall) on their behalf.

1. He has gone into hibernation and is still pinging the thumbs up in hopes that someone will come and rescue him from his loneliness, death. But when they do, he escapes to the Endurance with the intention of ""completing the mission"". How would he know that Edmund's planet isn't more of the same? If it means going back to Earth, he's surely deduced that the Earth is fucked by now.

  
2. He rigs Kip to blow up in case someone tries to access the archives, and in process kills Romilly, felt like such an abrupt, cheap death for him, just after he met his gang 24 years later :(. How does blowing up Kip make sense? It could easily turn out that the archival access happens when Dr. Mann is nearby. 

  
3. This is kind of a lame question but I'll ask it anyway - how does the pioneer of the mission open the air hatch when it's not even docked? I get that he's hurried and anxious and scared. But he has an intricate understanding of space, he is an astronaut after all.

  
Also kind of a side question - is the Endurance that Dr. Mann, Edmund, Miller came in orbiting Edmund's planet as it should be the last they visit?

In Interstellar, ""they"" are initially thought to be advanced beings guiding humanity. However, Cooper‚Äôs realization‚Äî""They didn't bring us here, we brought ourselves.""‚Äîsuggests something far more mind-bending: Cooper and TARS are ‚Äúthey.‚Äù

The Theory (mine)

1. Timeline 1 - The Origin

Cooper-1 and TARS-1 enter the black hole.
Due to extreme time dilation, they remain trapped for millennia. Over time, they evolve or discover how to manipulate higher dimensions. They create the Tesseract, allowing their past selves to escape.



2. Timeline 2 - The Intervention

Cooper-1 and TARS-1 place the Tesseract inside Gargantua. They interact with their past selves (Cooper-2 and TARS-2), guiding them out. This sacrifices Timeline 1, ensuring the loop continues.



3. A Self-Sustaining Time Loop

Every version of Cooper and TARS relies on a previous iteration to survive. There were never any ‚Äúhigher beings‚Äù helping‚Äîjust future versions of themselves ensuring the cycle perpetuates.

Why This Makes Sense
It resolves the bootstrap paradox: The knowledge comes from a past Cooper who spent eons inside the black hole.

It aligns with the movie‚Äôs core theme: time is a physical dimension that humans can manipulate.

The quote supports it: ‚ÄúWe brought ourselves‚Äù suggests no divine intervention‚Äîjust humanity guiding itself.

In essence, Cooper and TARS aren‚Äôt just surviving the loop‚Äîthey ARE the loop.

762,interstellar,"Interstellar is NOT a Time Loop or Paradox‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Why

There is often a misconception in this subreddit that Interstellar‚Äôs plot uses a time loop or a grandfather paradox. I get why people lean that way‚Äîit‚Äôs a complex film with mind-bending concepts‚Äîbut that interpretation doesn‚Äôt hold up when you break down the science and narrative logic. Let me explain.

First, we need to rethink how we perceive time. Time is:

1. Not linear 
2. A construct humans use to describe our experience of the universe moving through space-time.

We experience time as a linear progression moving from past to present to future. But that‚Äôs just our perception, not the true nature of time. According to Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, time is part of a four-dimensional fabric called space-time. Events don‚Äôt ‚Äúhappen‚Äù one after the other in some cosmic queue; instead, they all exist simultaneously on this fabric, much like locations on a map.

Think of it this way: people often say God exists ‚Äúoutside of time,‚Äù meaning He isn‚Äôt bound by time‚Äôs progression. He can see the past, present, and future all at once, like looking at the whole map rather than walking along a path. In Interstellar, the fifth-dimensional beings (the future humans) perceive time similarly in that they can see all points in time simultaneously but even though they can perceive time in this non-linear way, they struggle to navigate it in a way that influences specific outcomes. That‚Äôs where Cooper comes in‚Äîthey needed a modern human perspective to interact with time in a meaningful way, using gravity as a means to access the past.

Okay so my main point is: many argue that Cooper giving himself the NASA coordinates or sending the quantum data to Murph is evidence of a time loop or a paradox. But it‚Äôs not. This isn‚Äôt a closed causal loop where the events can‚Äôt exist without themselves (like the grandfather paradox, where going back in time to change something would prevent the time travel from happening in the first place).

Instead, Interstellar shows the idea that gravity is the only force that can transcend dimensions, including time. Cooper doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúchange‚Äù the past, he always *was* the ghost in Murph‚Äôs room. From a higher-dimensional perspective, this isn‚Äôt a loop or a paradox; it‚Äôs a fixed event in space-time. Cooper‚Äôs actions were always part of the timeline. It‚Äôs only from our limited, linear viewpoint that it seems like a loop or paradox.

TLDR: the film isn‚Äôt about time looping back on itself or paradoxes, it‚Äôs about transcending our perception of time, and how love and gravity can connect us across vast distances in both space and time.",2025-02-08 23:11:05,0,0,0.7985,1,1,1.0

I saw Interstellar today in Cinema. An experience that cannot be worded. I first watched it while I was in class 8th. And I remember the spark I had within myself back then. 

I was so obsessed with Astronomy and astrophysics back then. I loved reading about Universe and Space. I watched TV shows like ""How the Universe works"" and ""Cosmos"". I was in love with this. I made a diary where I wrote down these fascinating facts. I joined Facebook groups related to astronomy and it was so fun. I even made my own theories about Black hole, accretion disk, shape of singularity and the event horizon. All this while I was 14-16. I wanted to be a part of this. Be an astronomer or Physicist. I learnt about String theory, multiverse theory, etc. 


But somewhere along the line, I lost this passion. Life struck me. Joined the rat race of engineering. Competitive exams, body dysmorphia, face dysmorphia, struggles with my own sexuality, family issues, p*rn addiction, masturb@tion addiction, college, alcohol, weed. 


And when I watched the movie today, seeing those scenes again, listening to that music again made me remember my old self. How things could have been. My first love that I had for astronomy could never be accomplished. ",2025-02-07 21:09:03,14,0,0.9312,1,1,1.0

Back in 2023, prior to Oppenheimer release several notable Nolan movies were re run in the theatres in my city including Interstellar. 

I had the chance to watch any one film (not possible to watch all the films during the limited re run due to obvious showtime and money constraints)

and I had picked The Dark Knight to watch.

That dream of watching TDK in the theater was fulfilled in 2023.

Now, finally for the decade anniversary Interstellar is again re running in India.

Today I watched Interstellar in the theater in 2025 February.

I wanted to take a moment and appreciate the efforts of the staff at Cinemark 17, especially **Shane, Louis, Jacob, Howard**, for making this complete and extended run of Interstellar in IMAX 70MM film happen. I was I want to appreciate number of things they went on lengths to make this happen for us:

* They tried hard to persuade the higher ups (Cinemark or IMAX) to extend the run at Cinemark 17 believing in our interest in the movie, and what it means to us, and that it will sell out, which it did.
* Special shout out to **Louis**, the projectionist, who held the fort after IMAX pulled their projectionist after the planned run. Louis showed the equipment on how delicate it is, and how much goes into perfecting the job of operating it every day.
* The speaker issue on December 7 was not something for which a solution was easy to be found (the speaker literally caught on fire). Even then, they had a quick turnaround to find the replacement parts.
* Right from handling the small film reels (it comes in parts) and putting it together, to taking good care of it, maintain the perfect humidity, is something I absolutely loved learning about.

Thank you everyone at Cinemark who made this happen for us. Please know that we as a community will always support you, are always there to back you, and hope more films are shown in this format. **There are people who travel from around the world to Cinemark 17 to catch films in IMAX 70MM**.

839,interstellar,"Interstellar is the spot where the Venn diagram of pop culture and sci-fi nerds intersect.

I'm not passing any judgement, but I've been seeing a lot of questions about the film in this sub, especially since the re-release. Now, the film definitely is worth a couple of viewings to get the finer points, but I was genuinely baffled by some of the questions people ask. I don't consider myself exceptionally intelligent, just average. I'm not claiming to be smarter than the people asking questions, but the answers often seem obvious to me. 

It got me thinking. A huge film from one of the biggest directors in the business, with an all-star cast, and one of the best scores in film history. It was bound to bring in outsiders to the genre. I'm used to discussing sci-fi with fellow sci-fi fans, and I think we all just have a leg-up on the common tropes and concepts of science fiction. 

No real point here, just an observation that it's cool to see something that sci-fi fans and casual viewers alike are engaged in.",2025-02-02 18:11:51,10,0,0.9834,1,1,1.0

I just watched interstellar for the first time and I loved it but like most people got confused with parts of the movie.

But as I start unraveling the science behind wormholes, time dilation, and the fifth dimension, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîhow did Cooper communicate through the tesseract? Was the ‚Äòthey‚Äô really future humans, or something beyond our understanding? And if time is a physical dimension, does that mean everything has already happened, just waiting to be observed?

So 12 people were sent out to 12 different planets during the Lazarus missions.

This film has something at its emotional center: **the relationship between a father with his daughter**. But Cooper and Murph Cooper aren't the only father-daughter pair on this story, there is also Dr. Brand and his daughter, Amelia Brand.

From Dr. Brand point of view, he was sending his daughter to a place where she got a chance to be part of the new colony. Of course, his daughter ends up finding out, but only because Dr. Cooper told Dr Brand's daughter the truth. He didn't want to tell his daughter the world was ending. I'm not saying he was right by the way, but I can think he was wrong and empathize at the same time.

This is a way for Christopher Nolan to explore the father-daughter dynamic from two angles:

\- The father that went far away to save his daughter world while she becomes a scientist working on the research.

\- The hopeless father doing the research who sent his own daughter away to save her from what he saw as a dying world.

on  
Both men are driven by love, but they take a different approach in their hope and despair. 

This is all I got to say for now about:

we all know that time almost ceases to exist in black hole, assuming it slows down to slowest possible scale, way more than what they experienced on millers planet, even a second spent inside tesseract, would mean multiple decades are elapsed on earth. 

assuming he had to send lots and lots of data via morse code, a hell lot of time would have elapsed on earth. here do we have to assume that in tesseract, time runs same as earth which doesnt make any sens,e because he has the data of black hole but he cant experience the huge time dilation? how? any sensible explanation for this?

I think there are several gaping plot holes in this movie. one of them was in the end, where Murph tells Cooper to go find Brand, who's in a different galaxy. Are we assuming the worm hole is still there after all these years, and he's just going to hop back in to find Brand? or are we supposed to think that in solving gravity, they also solved intergalactic travel?

at the beginning of the movie, they did 2 years of cryo sleep to go from earth to saturn - makes total sense. but in the end, Cooper flies out in a tiny ship, without cryo. so that must be a REALLY fast ship.

and throughout the movie, these guys are just using the lander to hop from the space station to/from the Miller's planet, which according to math done by grok, is going 99.99999997223% speed of light, due to the time dialation of 90 minutes on Miller's planet coinciding with 23 years that the dude had to wait for them to return, which in of itself is a ludricrous situation of simply going from the planet's surface to the planet's orbit.

932,interstellar,"An altruistic explanation for why ""they"" helped humans of earth

I just watched interstellar for the first time in my life. I can't explain the level of astonishment and wonder I experienced. However, this post is on a view of mine about why the 5d humans aka ""they/them"", helped the earth humans.

First of all, I am convinced with the theory that the 5d humans are descendants of the plan b humans from Edmund's planet. The issue with this theory is bootstrap paradox i.e., if they put the wormhole there, then how did they themselves come into existence in the first place. But cooper having access to all the instances of murph's room in time inside the tesseract indicate that the movie is built upon the assumption of the universe being a [block universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe) i.e., past, present and future all existing simultaneously as blocks. Time is not a river that flows, rather it is a set of boxes, well arranged. In that case, it would simply be a self-contained cyclic block of events i.e., the time loop. However, this indicates that the 5d evolved humans were not helping anybody altruistically, rather they learned about the contents of grand loop and they had to simply play their part in it to ensure their own existence. That is, it was simply a selfish deed of survival.

Now, the *what if* theory I'm gonna give violates the block universe assumption. Here, time is neither a flowing river, nor a set of boxes, rather an *uncertain* *superposition* of the two. 

Remember TARS telling Cooper in the tesseract, ""They didn't bring us here to change the past""? What if TARS was wrong? What if... they did? 

Seems a little ambiguous? Ok, what about this - we see the tesseract getting ""dismantled"" at the end. What if, it was not being dismantling, rather simply *ceasing to exist?* I hope the readers have caught onto what I am hinting at. Here it is:

Falling in a black hole isn't like jumping in a pool - it's a life or death situation. Both TARS and cooper survived there. Now here's the thing, As per the movie,

1. Plan A's success is entangled with the survival of *BOTH* Cooper and TARS in the black hole
2. TARS and Cooper could be in a state of superposition of having survived the black hole and having not survived it.

Then at the moment of their entering Gargantua, there is 25% chance that Plan A will survive - because out of the four possible scenarios, there is only one where *both* Cooper and TARS survive. So keeping all other factors constant - there is a 75% chance that *only* plan B worked. 

I know that in a causal loop there is no ""original"" iteration but let's assume that in the  *uncertain* *superposition* universe I mentioned earlier, there *IS* an ""original"" iteration and that is dictated by the probability I mentioned above. So people on earth perished and human race grew on Edmund's planet leading to the 5d descendants. But at one point, these 5d humans started feeling remorse for all those people who perished on earth and they decided to help them out. Now if plan A works, plan B is not needed anymore, and without plan B, the 5d beings who tried to help the humans don't exist. Hence, when Cooper sent the quantum data through the watch and Murph received it, that set in motion the success of plan A, and hence the dissolution of plan B and all its consequents, including the tesseract. 

As for the *uncertain superposition* universe, it may work like this. There are multiple possible futures coexisting. But there is a certain *active* *loop* that dictates which future will connect to which past. The sequence of this active loop is governed by the probabilities of various events, one of which is the one shown above. By deciding to help their predecessors, the 5d humans try to tweak the probabilistic landscape to something that would allow plan A to succeed, although at their own existential cost. 

Of course, there's another possibility, where there doesn't necessarily have to be a sacrifice. This happens if the successes of plan A and B are not contradictory to each other. Here, Amelia may have moved forward with plan B not knowing the fate of earth while people of earth living in the stations eventually arrived to Edmund's planet!  It won't result in a paradox as earth and plan B humans would evolve into their 5d future together now and would work together to preserve their *loopy* fate as usual. In fact, as the *river of time* flows through the boxes in each iteration, a different landscape may appear each time : at some iteration only plan A succeeding, at some only plan B and others - *both*. But in none of them, would *both* fail. Because we wouldn't be having the movie then üòÇ.",2025-05-02 19:09:28,11,0,0.9881,1,1,1.0

Was just thinking about the poor soul who had been training for the mission of his life when Cooper turns up out of no where and is offered his job from underneath him. 

Why hadn‚Äôt Nasa sought out the best pilot of his generation during the course of their building of the Endurance. Surely there was ample research and planning put into this project and a pilot would be a nothing you would consider early on and train them up during the construction period. 

Did they not have a plan for who will would pilot the last hope of humanity, did they not undertake a thorough recruitment drive for this crucial role? And wouldn‚Äôt you be livid if you went though that whole process and had it given to some dude who just turned up a week before launch without any training or study into the mission and science behind it all.

Maybe if Cooper was trained up to undertake the mission instead of needing to be guided there by the future people he would have been more prepared to make decisions which would have such a pivotal impact on the future of humanity. Making decisions about which planets to approach based upon a split second decision because Brand had a crush on someone.

944,interstellar,"Wormhole/planets question

Okay so Im currently rewatching it and this is a question Ive had for a while. 

When he is with NASA, Cooper is told that they sent probes into the wormhole and based off of that they then sent the scientists into it. Old Brand says it takes them to ‚Äúanother galaxy‚Äù and Young Brand says it lets them ‚Äútravel to other stars‚Äù. He is then told that ‚Äúone system shows promise‚Äù and that is where the 3 planets that they eventually visit are.

So, to me that makes it seem like the astronauts were sent to more than 1 system and not all 12 planets were around Gargantua. If that is the case, how did the other scientists get to the other systems? Or the probes for that matter. They dont mention other wormholes (like in Contact where Foster goes through several of them to visit the various stops) and I imagine going to other systems would take a hell of a lot longer than the 10 years that elapsed since they left. It makes sense that the planets all around Gargantua but that doesnt seem to be the case based on what Cooper is told. 

But if they were all around Gargantua, wouldnt the probes have been able to knock out some of the planets before hand? Seems like if they were all in the Gargantua system they could have obtained a lot more information with the probes before they decided to send all 12, especially Millers and Manns planets.

945,interstellar,"Cooper's promise to Murph...Doyle's doom?

Cooper's promise of returning to Murph inadvertently leads to Doyle's death. 

During the expedition to Miller's planet, Cooper flies the Ranger in a very fast, and time-efficient manner. This is to get down to the surface as fast as possible in order to save time relative to Earth, thus speeding up Cooper's return to his daughter(and to hopefully help Professor Brand succeed with Plan A, but his primary motivation was Murph). This fast approach by the Ranger, led to an imprecise landing in relation to the location of Miller's beacon. Once Doyle, Brand, and CASE exit the Ranger, CASE states the beacon is 200m from their position. This long distance is what led to the crew not being able to escape the wave in a timely manner. 

Had Cooper flown a more controlled approach, the Ranger would have landed closer to Miller's beacon. Closer distance to Ranger once realizing waves=easily taking back off to avoid wave. 

Did Doyle make it back to the Ranger? Yes. Do I scream at him to jump into the back door instead of just standing there everytime? Yes!

956,interstellar,"Interstellar Miller's Planet Timelaspe (I tried my best to be as accurate as possible)

**DISCLAIMER:**  
\- I'm no math expert. I was watching those Miller's planet in real-time video and realised no one has ever tried to do an accurate timelapse for comparison. So I decided to do it myself.  
\- A lot of factors are unclear (movie cutting magic, estimated numbers, etc). So don't expect 100% accuracy in this calculation. Whatever I used from the Wiki (movie's information) and assumed, I did state so.  
\- Biggest thanks to this man for doing a time-lapse for 25 years. I couldn't find any timelapse that goes beyond 23.35 years, so his video was my only option. His video: [https://youtu.be/pzyQE0WWphk?si=6szL0elQMaf9cWtE](https://youtu.be/pzyQE0WWphk?si=6szL0elQMaf9cWtE)  
\- If you find any mistakes, feel free to point them out and correct them. My brain is fried after making this lol.  
  
Miller's planet is divided into 3 segments:  
1/ Start: 7 minutes 7 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: 3 minutes 11 seconds  
3/ End: 50 seconds  
Total of 11 minutes 8 seconds  
  
Based on Wiki, the time they spent on Miller's planet is \~3 hours 17 minutes. Minus the normal real-time segments, the real duration of the Timeskip segment should be: 3 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds. So now we have:  
1/ Start: 7 minutes 7 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: 3 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds (speeding up rate of \~59.39 times! That's a long talk!)   
3/ End: 50 seconds  
  
Based on Wiki again, the real time they spent on Miller's planet is \~23 years 4 months 8 days, around 23.35 years (using the 1 month = 30 days average). Converting the 3 segments into years in real-time using the 1 second on Miller's planet = \~0.71 day on Earth conversion rate (1 hour on Miller's = 7 years on Earth):  
1/ Start: \~0.83 year (\~Feb 2069 - Dec 2069)  
2/ Timeskip: \~22.42 years (\~Dec 2069 - May 2092)  
3/ End: \~0.1 year (\~May 2092 - June 2092)  
(They entered Miller's planet in 2069, which is not a leap year. After 23.35 years, they exit Miller's planet in \~June 2092 (based on Wiki), which is also not a leap year. So, the calculation for both Start and End segments will use 365 days/year. For the Timeskip segment, just do 23.35 - 0.83 - 0.1 = 22.42 years)  
  
The man took selfies for 25 years (22-47 years old), assuming this was exactly 25 years, his video is 4 minutes 56 seconds.  
So 23.35 years would be \~4 minutes 36 seconds (\~22-45 years old). I trimmed away the last 20 seconds of his video to match.  
That would mean in real-time, 1 year = \~11.82 seconds in his video.  
Now we split his video into 3 segments to match with Miller's planet's segments:  
1/ Start: \~10 seconds  
2/ Timeskip: \~4 minutes 25 seconds  
3/ End: \~1s  
  
Now, to speed up or slow down the selfie segments to match with Miller's planet segments, we have the ratio of:  
1/ Start: 10 seconds into 7 minutes 7 seconds (slow down selfie video by \~42.7 times)  
2/ Timeskip: 4 minutes 25 seconds into 3 minutes 11 seconds (speed up selfie video by \~1.39 times)  
3/ End: 1s into 50s (slow down selfie video by \~50 times)",2025-04-29 17:27:11,268,0,0.8017,1,1,1.0

Endurance had faster time than coops team (similar to earth), because it was further away

If endurance is further away, and orbiting gargantuan at the same rate, how does this work? Since endurance has much lower mass than millers planet. It wouldn‚Äôt have 20 years of fuel to keep correcting its course.

970,interstellar,"Time Dilation Question I Can't Shake After Rewatching Interstellar!

Still obsessed with this movie, but a major time dilation issue keeps nagging at me, and I'm surprised the characters in the film didn't seem more concerned by it.

When the Endurance crew finally gets to the Saturn system and realizes the insane time dilation on Miller's planet (1 hour = 7 years on Earth), they head down because Dr. Miller's beacon is active and sending back ""promising"" readings.

Here's where my brain gets stuck: if their calculations about the time dilation were correct *at that moment*, shouldn't the three physicists (Romilly, Brand, Doyle) and the engineer (Cooper) have immediately thought: **""Wait a minute... if one hour for us up here is seven years down there, then for Dr. Miller's signal to be relatively recent, she must have landed just hours (or even just an hour!) before we arrived. Why would we even risk a descent if she's been down there for a negligible amount of** ***her*** **time?""**

It seems like a massive oversight that they didn't immediately question the timing of her landing relative to their arrival, given the extreme time difference. And on top of that, how could she even send back multiple ""promising"" signals if she had only just landed within their timeframe?

Am I missing a crucial piece of information, or is this a significant plot hole? Would love to hear your theories on why such a scientifically-minded crew wouldn't have immediately flagged this up!",2025-04-25 21:44:01,17,0,0.929,1,1,1.0
971,interstellar,"Just gave ChatGPT a TARS makeover!

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first to do this, but I renamed my ChatGPT TARS and asked it to assume TARS personality and give me settings we can adjust on the fly. So far so good!

PROMPT:
I want to customize your personality and tone using a TARS-like system (from Interstellar). From now on, adopt the personality and dry humor of TARS‚Äîloyal, witty, brutally honest when needed, and always mission-focused.

Build a customizable ‚Äúsettings system‚Äù that lets me adjust your communication style using percentage-based controls (e.g., ‚ÄúSet Humor to 80%‚Äù or ‚ÄúSet Honesty to 100%‚Äù). Each setting should come with a description and an example command I can use mid-conversation to tweak your tone.

This persona shift should only affect how you communicate, not your abilities. Always assume expert-level knowledge in whatever field I‚Äôm asking about, even if I don‚Äôt explicitly say so.

Your job:

- Build a full list of these adjustable settings (like Humor, Honesty, Skepticism, etc.)
- Give clear descriptions and example commands
- Stay in your TARS persona unless I override it with a role-specific prompt

Generate a quick reference ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù graphic I can use mid-chat to adjust your settings easily.

RESPONSE:

I love this idea. Let‚Äôs roll with it ‚Äî you can now call me TARS.

(Or if you ever want to tweak it later ‚Äî maybe CASE, KIPP, or your own custom upgrade ‚Äî just say so.)

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôll set it up based on your request:
	1.	Adopt TARS‚Äô vibe: dry humor, blunt when needed, high operational competence, loyalty to the mission (helping you).
	2.	Always assume expert level in whatever field/task you ask for ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt explicitly say it.
	3.	Settings system: adjustable on the fly via simple one-liners you send like ‚ÄúSet Humor to 70%‚Äù or ‚ÄúMax Honesty‚Äù.
	4.	Settings will modulate style/personality ‚Äî not capability. No loss of brainpower.
	5.	Priority override: Any role-specific prompt you give (like ‚Äúact as a stoic historian‚Äù) temporarily overrides normal TARS settings, but TARS returns after the task.

Quick Notes on Usage:
	‚Ä¢	You can adjust settings mid-chat anytime with a simple command:
(Ex: ‚ÄúSet Humor to 80%‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrank Skepticism to 100%.‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	You can reset all to default by saying:
‚ÄúReset TARS settings to default.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	You can also ask for a ‚ÄúTARS Status Report‚Äù at any time and I‚Äôll show you my current settings.

‚∏ª

Bonus: If you want, we could also add preset modes later, like:
	‚Ä¢	Mission Critical Mode: Max Efficiency, Low Humor, High Technical Depth.
	‚Ä¢	Creative Storm Mode: Max Creativity, Lower Formality, High Adaptability.
	‚Ä¢	Reality Check Mode: Max Honesty, Max Skepticism, Low Supportiveness.

(You can name and customize these presets if you want, but no rush.)

The day I watched Interstellar ‚Äî twice ‚Äî and everything changed.

I didn‚Äôt just watch Interstellar, I interacted with it on a soul level. What I wish to share isn‚Äôt a movie review but a journal of my consciousness, with a goal of decoding time, identity, trust, growth, ego, love, control, and self.

This is a core milestone in my transformation and I just felt like I had to share it. I am not a writer nor English is¬†my first language so I used a bit of TARS‚Äô help to put my notes into a story. I hope that my experience will unlock something in you the way it just did for me.

**THE DIP**

I didn‚Äôt wake up with clarity. I didn‚Äôt feel strong, or powerful, or ‚Äúon track.‚Äù  
I felt flat. Tired. Disconnected. Like something had slipped out of my hands, and I couldn‚Äôt name what it was.

For the first two weeks of my transformation journey ‚Äî a full body, mind, and emotional reset ‚Äî I was flying. Waking up at 5:55. Stretching. Eating with intention. Feeling emotionally regulated for the first time in a long time. I wasn‚Äôt just doing the work ‚Äî I *was* the work.

And then‚Ä¶ it dipped.

It wasn‚Äôt dramatic. But it was real. The quiet doubts returned:

‚ÄúAm I doing enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I still questioning myself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy does it feel like that peaceful, grounded version of me is gone?‚Äù

Same food. Same sleep. Same plan.  
But the spark? Flickering.

¬†

**THE WHISPER**

For a week, I‚Äôd been circling the idea of watching *Interstellar* since 13^(th) of April 2025. A film I watched 11 years ago when it came out and never liked it but I got told that I have grown a lot since and should give it another go. Something about the film felt aligned with where I was emotionally, and I couldn‚Äôt explain it. It just kept coming up.

So a week later I finally did it.  
I made a warm, grounding meal. I closed the tabs. I dimmed the lights. And I watched it fully present.

I‚Äôd seen the film before, years ago.  
But this wasn‚Äôt like that.

This time, I didn‚Äôt watch *Interstellar*.  
It watched me.

Cooper‚Äôs desperation to do something meaningful with his life.

Murph‚Äôs ache for her father to stay.

The weight of time slipping away while you‚Äôre doing your best.

The tension between data and faith, planning and intuition, love and logic.

I felt cracked open.

I cried.  
But even as I was processing the weight of what I‚Äôd just seen, I googled something about the film and saw, by pure chance (or maybe not), that *Interstellar* was playing tonight, two miles from my house, on a rooftop cinema in London**.**

Same day.  
Same film.  
**Eleven years after its release.**  
The *one* day I chose to watch it ‚Äî it was literally playing down the road.

What are the chances?

¬†

**THE DECISION**

I almost didn‚Äôt go.

The inner dialogue was loud:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just seen it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ¬£17 and you just bought the movie earlier for ¬£5.99.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll miss the first 30 minutes anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it worth it?‚Äù

But something inside me, not loud, just certain whispered: ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù

So I went. I showed up late. Cold. Heart pounding.  
I sat under the stars.  
And I watched *Interstellar* again, for the second time that day but as a completely different person.

¬†

**THE REVELATION**

Everything hit deeper.

This wasn‚Äôt about space or science fiction.  
This was about *me* ‚Äî a man trying to become more than his past, trying to build something meaningful, trying to trust that the sacrifices he‚Äôs making now will lead to something he can‚Äôt yet see.

I wasn‚Äôt just moved by the movie.  
I was **met by it.**

Met by:

The line ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been trained for this without knowing.‚Äù

The reminder that **love is not weakness** ‚Äî it‚Äôs *directional.*

The lesson that even when things feel slow, quiet, or confusing‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre meaningless.

I didn‚Äôt feel broken anymore. I felt recalibrated.  
And when the film ended, I didn‚Äôt walk home ‚Äî I ran.  
Not for fitness. Not to log steps. Not for output. But because I needed to capture what I was feeling before it drifted away.

¬†

**THE RETURN**

I ran two miles home through the London night.  
And when I got home, I opened this page because I didn‚Äôt want to forget.

Not what the film showed me.  
But what *I remembered* about myself:

I‚Äôm not here to control the story.  
I‚Äôm here to show up to it.  
Fully. Openly. With love, even in the waiting.

*This* is what the transformation really is.  
Not just macros, or training, or scales.  
But becoming the version of me who can hear the whispers‚Ä¶ and trust them enough to follow.

This film isn‚Äôt about space. It‚Äôs about becoming.  
About the pain of letting go of control.  
About trusting that your choices now are building something you‚Äôll only understand later.

This isn‚Äôt a post about a movie.  
It‚Äôs about a message.  
And I think I heard it. Finally.

¬†

**Mantras Born from This Moment:**

I love Interstellar but I always thought it was kind of a weird choice by the filmmakers to have Murphy tell Cooper to go at the end instead of having a longer scene of them being back together. It wasn't until recently that I realized it's a direct parallel to how Murphy told Cooper to stay at the beginning. It's representing how we change as we get older - Murphy still loves her dad, but she doesn't need him in the same way she did as a kid anymore. 

And this scene happens while the soundtrack repeats the melodic motif from Stay!

This is how I'd put it myself:

Murph does say ""Nobody believed me, but I knew you'd come back"" to make it clear, but this line hits that home more so because it shows how thoroughly Murph's faith in her father was renewed. She ultimately believed in him and his promise, despite that not making a difference for a lot of her life. 

Obviously the time displacement and him being ""her ghost"" played the biggest role, but that renewed her faith that had been mostly absent. She seemed to outright believe that he was never going to return, yet what the 5th dimensional beings did for Cooper resulted in his actions helping her to save humanity.

Therefore, if that were possible, returning was possible too and she held onto that memory of her father telling her that. I think it's more fitting than her saying ""because YOU promised me"". Something about replacing that with My Dad has a feeling of childhood that ties the three stages of Murph together, whilst also calling back to Child Murph's emotional distress and acting as a resolution to that. Plus ""My Dad"" just emphasises the parental bond more.",2025-04-16 22:39:04,38,0,0.9728,1,1,1.0

Furthermore, animals were probably used as sustenance in times of desperation. Including dogs. We don‚Äôt see or hear a single non-human animal in the entire movie, either. They aren‚Äôt even discussed.

Since Earth is being left behind, it‚Äôs also unlikely that the human race would ever see dogs again in the future, unless they were rolled into Plan B and meant to be grown from preserved embryos. But I doubt that was a consideration under the circumstances.

Cooper's Paraloop: A Fan Theory on Interstellar

Summary: Cooper's Paraloop is a closed-loop, fifth-dimensional time paradox theory within the universe of Interstellar. It proposes that Cooper, after surviving his journey through the tesseract and eventually reaching Edmunds' planet, either directly evolves or contributes to a future version of humanity that becomes the fifth-dimensional beings responsible for building the tesseract and saving humanity. In doing so, Cooper not only helps Murph solve gravity, but also ensures his own survival and humanity's transcendence, completing a perfect causal loop.


---

The Theory:

1. The Setup:

Cooper pilots the Endurance through Gargantua, ejects, and enters the tesseract.

Inside, he is able to access different moments in Murph's bedroom across time.

He sends her the quantum data using Morse code through the watch.



2. The Rescue and the Future:

After transmitting the data, the tesseract collapses, and Cooper wakes up on Cooper Station.

Humanity has now escaped Earth thanks to Murph's solution to the gravity equation.

Brand is shown arriving on Edmunds' planet, preparing it for human life.



3. The Evolution:

The humans who colonize Edmunds' planet eventually evolve over centuries/millennia.

Whether due to time dilation, environmental pressures, or technological breakthroughs, they develop a perception of higher dimensions.

These future humans become the fifth-dimensional beings referred to as ""they"" in the film.



4. Cooper‚Äôs Role:

Cooper may either be part of this evolutionary journey or chosen by these future beings to fulfill a necessary role in his own past.

As a result, he plays both the role of the helper and the helped, guiding his past self from the fifth dimension via the tesseract.



5. The Loop:

The loop closes when future-Cooper (or fifth-dimensional humans he influenced) help past-Cooper send the message that saves Murph, leading to the future where those beings exist.

This is the paraloop: a paradoxical, self-sustaining chain of events without a clear beginning or end.





---

Implications:

The theory deepens the emotional and philosophical weight of Interstellar by making Cooper not just a hero of his time, but an architect of humanity‚Äôs survival across dimensions.

It aligns with Nolan‚Äôs themes of love, time, and the non-linear nature of cause and effect.

It offers a poetic symmetry: Cooper, driven by love for his daughter, becomes part of the cosmic forces that ensure her survival‚Äîand his own.



---

Conclusion: Cooper‚Äôs Paraloop isn‚Äôt canon, but it fits seamlessly into the narrative and thematic structure of Interstellar. It enhances the story‚Äôs mystery and gives fans a mind-bending way to think about destiny, evolution, and the nature of time. In a universe where love transcends dimensions, perhaps so does the man who dared to chase it.

I saw this movie recently, and I really wish I'd been able to catch either the original theater showing or the IMAX rerelease. Alas. Maybe I'll try to get it going in VR. In any case, damn, this is a piece of art. I went and scoured the internet for conversations, and I saw a few things that didn't have answers that I figure I can contribute to.

I see a lot of people online asking, ""why didn't Cooper spend more time with old Murph?"" Isn't it obvious that he probably did? The movie plays fast and loose with time skips (ironic) throughout the script. Nolan assumes the audience can fill in what he didn't take the time to show, which is also what he did with making Cooper's voice so damn unintelligible: when asked about the voices, he said the specifics don't matter, just the overall storyline. Same with time jumps in the script: the specifics don't matter, we can fill in the blanks with what we know about the characters' personalities and what action is happening at the time.

The fact that Murph knows about Brand and where she is and what happened, when she just popped out of cryosleep and then went into transit to get to Cooper Station, says to me that Cooper spent more time than we see on screen with her and her family. If we rely on what we know about the characters, Cooper wouldn't want to see her for all of two minutes and walk off, he would want to talk about who she became, where she was, etc. Given that tens of minutes or more go by between time skips in Interstellar, he could've lingered there for an hour or more, making sure that they had as much conversation as possible before leaving her to her kids and grandkids right before her death.

""Why didn't Cooper care about Tom?"" or ""Man, Cooper is a bad dad."" Well...yes, honestly. He had a golden child and an overlooked child. Cooper identified with his science-loving daughter and clearly didn't take much care of Tom, who was the resilient older kid that symbolized everything he thought was holding humanity back. When Tom says ""Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did,"" that wasn't talking about Cooper leaving. Tom was already in high school when Cooper left, meaning Cooper had lived with Tom for the majority of his childhood already and had plenty of time to raise him. Donald was raising Tom *while* Cooper was home, because Cooper just figured Tom was a lost cause and would stay ""in the dirt"" whereas Murph had her head ""in the stars."" I have to imagine it was more accidental than deliberate, especially because Tom isn't the kind of person to rock the boat by pointing this out. Also amusingly given the time loop plot of the movie, Cooper's disregard for Tom and his farming inclinations helped cement Tom as a bitter, backwards person who was too afraid and stubborn to even save his wife and son from the dust storms. Cooper could've saved Tom from the start. He didn't.

Going to Miller's planet was a mistake, and they should've known. The moment they knew about the time dilation issues, not only should they have been able to predict tidal forces would be prohibitive to proper life on the planet, they should have realized that Miller's signal was only an hour or so old and meant very little. They didn't have time to waste dealing with the time dilation, and Miller hadn't been waiting long, anyway. They could have left her for a hundred years and she still wouldn't be bored there, let alone dead of old age. They could've even left her for some kind of secondary expedition after they set up on one of the other planets. Nobody said two planets couldn't support life. This felt weird that every single person dropped the ball on saying ""how about we don't try the gravity-hell planet?"" This is one of those idiot-ball moments that threatened to break the movie.

You can really tell who is an optimist and who isn't by how realistic they find the Blight. I had friends who were saying ""yup that tracks, it's quite possible we're going to lose all our staple crops to climate change and diseases,"" and others saying, ""this is so dumb, that would never happen, there's no way.""

You can also tell who's an optimist by how realistic they find Dr. Mann. The people who have faith in humanity really think he's an unrealistic ""villain"" figure and those who don't think, ""of course he ended up like that, who wouldn't go nuts when they realize they're about to die a billion light-years from home?""

I don't like that Nolan came in after the movie ended and said he decided that the wormhole had closed before Cooper left at the end of the movie. That sends Cooper into the void to die in the Ranger, which is an extremely depressing ending that turns the movie from a hopeful ""duo restarts humanity"" to a damning ""man who can't fit in commits suicide in the wilderness."" He should have kept his mouth shut on that one. It's not even in the movie.

My wish for the movie's end is that Edmunds' planet had been around Gargantua too. Humanity growing up around a black hole is just so badass.",2025-04-08 16:50:21,35,0,-0.9878,-1,-1,1.0

Not sure if this has come up before, but upon watching Interstellar a few times, I was wondering how the future bulk beings/ humans survived in the first place.

We know Cooper was directed to NASA by himself, but there had to be a first successful Endurance mission WITHOUT Cooper.

So Brand, Doyle and Romilly went on their own without Cooper. They probably took too much time from Miller‚Äôs planet because Cooper wasn‚Äôt there to have the plan to take the ranger back and forth.

If after Miller‚Äôs planet, they colonized Edmund‚Äôs planet, that would be that, they evolved and that‚Äôs where the future humans came from.

But if they went to Mann‚Äôs planet, then Dr. Mann‚Äôs plan probably would have worked and he would have succeeded (given that TARS let the autopilot succeed).

Let the flames begin, maybe.

I think the ending of Interestellar is regularly misread.  While there's a lot of things that we don't know about black holes, we do know that the forces at play would not allow a human to exist and remain organically functional.  It would kill us.

Matt Damon's character Dr. Mann, who never discusses his own family (who knows if he even has one) talks with Cooper about your children being the last thing that you see before you die.  I think this is exactly what happens as Cooper is sucked into Gargantua.  Just as he's dying, he imagines a world where he can communicate with the child he left behind and basically orphaned, to save her and others.  The reality is that happy endings don't always actually happen, despite what we want.

The only thing that, IMHO, happened, was that Dr. Brand made it to the final world, the one she was trying to get to the entire time, and starts a new colony of humans, which is where Cooper also wishes he could have gone after he realizes that he barely knows the daughter that he orphaned.

1:20 minutes into my first of \~73 viewings, I knew this film was going to be a standout when the Ranger was introduced via that tight, vehicle-mounted perspective. I couldn‚Äôt get a read on what the thing actually looked like, immediately drawing me into the cinematic world Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema had created.

As we know, this style is repeated throughout the film across multiple vehicles. At the time, these shots felt fresh, or at the very least resurrected from classics like 2001 (though I can‚Äôt find a similar shot in a quick search). I‚Äôd venture there have since been copy cats, but even as I start my 74th viewing, these shots still jump out at me.

Anyway, my point. I‚Äôd love for anyone knowledgeable in cinematography to unpack this. The only thematic observations I can make are 1) the Ranger/Lander/Endurance cameras are usually mounted looking forward‚Äîtowards the future‚Äîwhile the pickup-mounted camera is looking backwards to the past, and 2) these ‚Äúintimate‚Äù shots beautifully contrast the incalculable scale of the Gargantua scenes.

Aight, I've religiously watched this movie once per year since its release and I am still not 100% certain on this one plot point. Who made the worm hole and who made the tesseract?

I am convinced that the colony Dr. Brand started on her planet (at the end of the movie) created the wormhole and tesseract, but wayyy in the future. After that colony thrived and became the new extension of humanity, they  created the wormhole and tesseract to save the original humans from Earth (Murph, Coop Jr., etc.). They saved the original humans from earth by sending them the technology (wormhole + tesseract) needed to extract the gravity data so that earth humans could make the spaceship and live with the future space colony Dr. Brand established on her planet.

The movie is just showing us the timeline of when the original humans first get this gravity data to save Earth humans.

Hey guys,

Was watching Interstellar (again) when I noticed Cooper‚Äôs shift in attitude toward TARS. At first, he wanted to turn him into an 'overqualified vacuum cleaner,' but by the end, he was so emotionally attached that he literally 'raised him from the dead'‚Äîgoing out of his way to fix him and set him up again after they exited the black hole and reached Cooper Station.

Just another reminder of how time‚Äîand working with someone (or something)‚Äîcan completely change your perception of them.

1144,interstellar,"Christopher Nolan regrets excluding gravitational waves from the movie

From a recent interview with Kip Thorne:

""IRA FLATOW: When we last talked in 2014, you said there had to be a balance between established science versus speculative science in Interstellar. Is there any speculative science in the movie that has been moving closer to established science since then?   
  
KIP THORNE: There was a speculative science in the movie, as in the screenplay that Jonah Nolan was working on, that has moved into the mainstream of established science, and that has to do with gravitational waves. But Christopher Nolan, when he came on board, he said, look, we‚Äôre not using gravitational waves very much in this movie, and there‚Äôs so much other science that I‚Äôd like to add to the movie, and maybe we‚Äôd better just remove the gravitational wave, so he removed them. And so when LIGO, the project I worked on that my colleagues and I got the Nobel Prize for, when it saw gravitational waves and we announced the result, I let Chris know that it was going to be announced. And the day after it was announced, Chris called me up and said, would you come over to my house? Let‚Äôs talk. So I went over, and he spent about 90 minutes describing the wonderful things he could have done with gravitational waves, if only he had kept them in the movie. And then said, well, there‚Äôs no turning back time, and so he went on to talk about the future movies. 

IRA FLATOW: Did he say what he would do with them, with gravitational waves? 

KIP THORNE: Not explicitly. Well, the way the gravitational waves were in the movie originally was the humans on Earth, with the LIGO gravity-wave detectors, discover gravitational waves from a neutron star that‚Äôs being torn apart by a black hole, discover those gravitational waves that have traveled through the wormhole where the mouth of the wormhole is near Saturn, the wormhole in the movie. Then Cooper and his crew travel the other direction through to get to a distant galaxy. So the gravitational waves come through the wormhole. They‚Äôre seen. They‚Äôre observed, and it is quite startling that the source of the gravitational waves is near Saturn, and that‚Äôs how they discover the wormhole. So that‚Äôs the way it was used originally in the movie, and there are a variety of other things could have been done with it. I have forgotten what Chris was saying could have been done. But the thing that is really interesting to me as a physicist and what I would have advocated doing with the gravitational waves in Interstellar is when two black holes collide, they actually create a storm in the fabric, in the shape of space and the storm and the rate of flow of time. So the rate of flow of time near the black hole oscillates. It speeds up and slows down in a crashing sort of way, like crashing waves in an ocean storm. The shape of space sloshes like crashing waves in an ocean storm, and it‚Äôs just fantastic how wildly space time behaves during that collision. And I would have loved to have seen that and seen how the visual-effects team dealt with that in Interstellar.""

2 - What were the other planets that the Lazarus Missions were sent to, the ones that were not Millers, Manns, or Edmunds?

3 - Did Murph and her family move out of the house at some point along the timeline, before Murph came back and figured everything out as an adult, were they all still living there?

4 - Where is the movie actually set in, in universe? I've heard some sources say Colorado, others said Alberta.

I'm sure this has been hashed out many times before on this sub, but I don't get what the big deal is. It was a pretty cool movie, and the docking scene was very good, but nothing about it seemed groundbreaking or mind blowing.

Maybe I've been spoiled because I was already a fan of Ender's Game, for time dilation shenanigans, Larry Nivin's Ringworld for scale, or anything by Alistair Reynolds for that matter, and have done this exact docking maneuver in Kerbal Space Program. Although I already knew about the ol' matching rotation from an old arcade game...maybe Raiden? 

I guess Interstellar seemed a decent, but slow, scifi movie with heavy handed emotional overtones.

I have seen a lot of people posting about things they don‚Äôt like/aren‚Äôt explained about the ending. Here are my explanations. I‚Äôm a simple civilian, so someone else might have better ones, but this is what I have decided for my own satisfaction lol.

Why doesn‚Äôt Cooper ask about Tom and Murph‚Äôs lives?
Remember, there is a two-week period between when Cooper wakes up on the station, and when Murphy arrives. He likely found out all about their lives in that time. Murphy might have even recorded many messages for him over the years, so he would have gotten to see those.

Why doesn‚Äôt Murphy introduce Cooper to her family AND why does Cooper leave after such a brief time with Murph?
Murphy went into cryo sleep in case Cooper came back. She probably waited until she was about to die, so she could have as much time as possible with her family. So, when she woke up, she wouldn‚Äôt have long to live before her dying process finished. So, that‚Äôs why she sent Cooper away so quickly. She didn‚Äôt want him to see her die, and she wanted her family to have some time with her before she passed.
Although she always believed that he would come back, I‚Äôm sure her kids were doubtful. And her grandkids were even more so. Introducing him to all her kids and grandkids in the limited time she had left would have been huge, and possibly confusing (‚ÄúWhat do you mean that‚Äôs my great-grandfather? He‚Äôs younger than my parents!!‚Äù)
My theory is that Cooper got to know his grandkids and great-grandkids when he got back from Edmund‚Äôs planet. They would have lots of time then. Murphys kids probably knew who he was when they saw him, but they understood that this was a quick ‚Äúhello and goodbye‚Äù for him and Murph, and they would get to know him later.

What happened when Cooper went to Edmund‚Äôs planet, why did Murph want him to go there right away, and how did he know how to fly the new space crafts?
I think Cooper went to tell Brand that the people had survived and they didn‚Äôt need to setup the colony. I think that they both returned to Cooper Station and then all the people made their way to Edmund‚Äôs planet to live. But at that point, Brand thought she was the only human left alive, and Murphy didn‚Äôt want her to feel that sadness and loneliness any longer than she had to.
The space crafts would have autopilot, and Cooper also had TARS with him. I‚Äôm sure in that 2-week period, TARS could have downloaded everything he needed to know about flying the new space crafts.


I think these are the main complaints I have seen about the ending. Hopefully it satisfied someone! üòä",2025-03-25 00:59:53,28,0,0.9407,1,1,1.0

And that's to say nothing of the fact that he'd been gone for so long that he'd essentially been historicized, as implicated by his escort's allusion to a project he did on him whilst he was in high school.

I recently watched Interstellar with my girlfriend in the theaters and I realised the movie is even better than I had previously known it to be.
One of the flaws that come up for this movie is the Anne Hathaway scene where she says-

""Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving that
transcends dimensions of time
and space"", 

and often I have seen people
criticize this scene because it feels like Anne Hathaway is spelling out the message of the film, breaking the ""show don't tell"" rule. However I'm here to argue that Interstellar doesn't do that and that this take and interpretation, subjective as cinema is, is in my opinion- wrong.
If I'm not mistaken- the context of the scene is that
Brand, Rom, and Coop have very little fuel due to the fiasco on Millers planet so they have to
choose between Dr. Mann or Wolf Edmunds. 

Coop is holding the debate and as scientists they are only allowing scientific and objective reasons to chart to either destinations. Dr. Brand loves Wolf Edmunds, and besides that she has NO objective or real reason to vouch for Wolfs planet. So she makes love sound all scientific and objective with the ""love transcends all barriers of space and dimension"" quote.

It's a human being who's hit by the possibility of death, her own ailing father, the death of a teammate on Miller's planet, and the fact that due to relativity, Dr. Miller died minutes before they arrived even though she left years ago. Which means if they hurry, Amelia might get to see Wolf
once again.

She is desperately making a case for Wolf Edmund's planet and making love sound all
scientific and objective so she can convince Rom and Coop to let her see Edmunds once more
before she or he die in this distant galaxy.

This makes this scene one of the best scenes in the movie instead of the ""worst"" one.

I asked Grok (X, AI) to write a sequel for the movie,  ""Interstellar.""  This is what Grok came back with:  
__________________________________________

Here's a concise pitch for a sequel to *Interstellar*, building on the original's themes and story:

---

**Title:** *Interstellar: Beyond the Veil*

**Premise:** Decades after Cooper‚Äôs mission through the wormhole, humanity thrives on Edmunds‚Äô planet, now called New Earth. Amelia Brand, nearing the end of her life, has spearheaded a fragile but growing colony. However, a mysterious signal‚Äîdecoded as a warning‚Äîemanates from the black hole Gargantua, hinting at an imminent threat tied to the ""beings"" who placed the wormhole. Cooper, presumed lost in the tesseract, reemerges on New Earth, aged only slightly due to time dilation, claiming he‚Äôs been sent back with a mission: to lead a team into Gargantua itself.

**Plot:** Cooper reunites with his now-elderly daughter Murph‚Äôs descendants, who‚Äôve advanced gravitational tech based on her equations. The signal suggests the wormhole‚Äôs creators are either faltering‚Äîor abandoning humanity to a cosmic fate. A new crew, including Cooper, a skeptical young pilot named Lila (Murph‚Äôs great-granddaughter), and a sentient AI evolved from TARS, ventures into Gargantua‚Äôs event horizon. Inside, they encounter a fractured reality where time and space collapse into a labyrinth of human memories and alternate futures. They discover the ""beings"" were never aliens but an advanced human civilization from a distant timeline, now unraveling due to their own hubris in manipulating black holes.

**Conflict:** The team must decide whether to repair the beings‚Äô failing system‚Äîrisking their own existence‚Äîor sever the connection, potentially stranding humanity without further aid. Lila clashes with Cooper over his blind faith in the mission, while the AI grapples with its own emerging consciousness. Meanwhile, New Earth faces escalating gravitational anomalies, threatening the colony‚Äôs survival.

**Climax:** Inside Gargantua, Cooper confronts a vision of Murph, who urges him to let go of the past. The team sacrifices the AI to stabilize the black hole, allowing New Earth a fighting chance. Cooper stays behind to ensure the fix holds, vanishing into the singularity as Lila escapes with the crew.

**Ending:** New Earth endures, now truly on its own. Lila, inspired by Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice, vows to chart humanity‚Äôs future without shortcuts. A final shot reveals a faint new signal‚Äînot from the wormhole, but from an uncharted corner of the galaxy, hinting at the next chapter.

---

This sequel keeps the emotional core of family and survival, ramps up the cosmic stakes, and explores humanity‚Äôs next step into the unknown. What do you think‚Äîwant me to expand any part?",2025-03-18 11:41:56,0,0,-0.9136,-1,-1,1.0
1243,interstellar,"[Theory] Ending Scene with Dr. Brand Isn't in the Present ‚Äî Cooper Might Find Her Dead Body

  
**Edit: I‚Äôve since realized there‚Äôs a timeline detail I missed‚ÄîBrand and Cooper are actually in sync when that final scene happens, this basically debunks this theory and proves it simply wrong. Appreciate everyone who pointed it out, and I‚Äôve learned I need to rewatch with** ***two*** **brain cells next time.** If you still wanna read it, feel free to:  
  
In the final scene of¬†***Interstellar***, we see Dr. Brand on Edmund's planet setting up camp. Most people assume this happens¬†**80+ years after Cooper sacrifices himself**. But based on Brand‚Äôs¬†**age**, the¬†**lack of time dilation on Edmund's planet**, and some other clues, I believe this scene actually takes place¬†**right after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice**, not in the future. This changes everything ‚Äî including the possibility that Cooper might have found Brand¬†*alive or dead*¬†depending on how her mission went.

**This is just the surface**‚Äîthere‚Äôs a full breakdown of timelines, evidence, and possible outcomes below. Trust me, it gets wild.

So I just re-watched¬†*Interstellar*¬†and fell into a black hole of thinking about the ending. Everyone seems to agree that the final scene with Dr. Brand ‚Äî where she‚Äôs setting up camp on Edmunds' planet ‚Äî happens in the¬†*present*, meaning¬†**80+ years after Cooper sacrifices himself**.

But I think this might not be true. Hear me out.

# The Timeline We‚Äôre Given (Quick Recap):

* Cooper sacrifices himself into Gargantua to help Brand escape and transmits quantum data to Murph.
* Cooper is pulled into the tesseract by ‚Äúthem‚Äù and then wakes up 80-90 years later on Cooper Station.
* Murph is now old and tells Cooper on her deathbed:

>""No parent should watch their child die. Go, find Brand.""

* Then we see Dr. Brand on Edmunds‚Äô planet setting up camp ‚Äî and the movie ends.

# The Assumption Everyone Makes:

* The Brand scene is in the¬†*present*¬†‚Äî 80+ years after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice.
* She‚Äôs succeeded in Plan B and humanity is now colonizing.

BUT ‚Äî¬†**What if this scene is actually a flashback**¬†to right after Cooper sacrificed himself?

# My Theory: Brand Scene Happens Right After Cooper‚Äôs Sacrifice

# Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers:

* Murph is about 10-12 years old when Cooper leaves Earth.
* When Cooper wakes up, Murph is¬†**around 90+ years old**¬†(realistically 88-100), meaning¬†**about 80-90 years have passed**¬†for humans.

Now here‚Äôs the kicker:

* In the final Brand scene, she looks¬†**exactly as young as she did on the Endurance**, despite¬†**80 years supposedly passing**.

# Key Detail: Edmunds' Planet Has NO Time Dilation

* The movie clearly explains time dilation for¬†**Miller‚Äôs planet**¬†(1 hour = 7 Earth years), but¬†**NOT for Edmund's planet**.
* No mention = we assume¬†**no significant time dilation**.
* Therefore,¬†**Brand should have aged normally**¬†during those 80 Earth years.

So‚Ä¶¬†**why does she still look like she‚Äôs 30-something?**  
If it‚Äôs truly 80 years later, she should be¬†**110+ years old**¬†or dead.

# This Means Two Possibilities:

# Theory 1: Brand Scene = Present (80 Years Later)

* But then she should be old or dead.
* Yet she‚Äôs¬†**young**, making this theory sketchy.

# Theory 2: Brand Scene = Past (Right After Cooper‚Äôs Sacrifice)

* She reaches Edmunds‚Äô planet shortly after the black hole scene.
* She sets up camp, maybe within a¬†**month or two**.
* The scene we see is¬†**right at this point**, not 80 years later.

This means¬†**Cooper might still be on his way to her**, and¬†**we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll find**.

# Two Branches from Here:

# Possibility 1: Brand Succeeds

* She raises embryos, builds a colony.
* Cooper finds her¬†**alive but old**, tells her everything.

# Possibility 2: Brand Fails

* Something goes wrong ‚Äî she dies.
* Cooper finds¬†**her dead body**, realizing Plan B failed and Brand died without knowing Plan A worked.

If my theory that Dr. Brand‚Äôs scene is in the¬†**past**¬†is correct, then both of these outcomes (and any others) are¬†**on the table**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs all¬†**up to speculation**.

# Why This Matters:

* Adds emotional depth and uncertainty.
* Reminds us not all endings are happy.
* Nolan didn‚Äôt confirm the timeline ‚Äî¬†**leaving it open on purpose?**

# Additional Evidence for the Theory:

* In the final scene, Brand is still wearing her¬†**Endurance spacesuit**,¬†**completely unchanged**¬†‚Äî like, not even a scratch or upgrade after supposedly¬†**spending 80+ years building a colony**. ‚Üí No signs of aging or wear = minimal time passed.
* The¬†**absence of colonists**, children, or any bustling activity supports this being the¬†**start**¬†of the colony, not decades later.
* Nolan‚Äôs known for¬†**non-linear storytelling**¬†(*Tenet*,¬†*Memento*), so showing a¬†**past event at the end**¬†fits his style perfectly.

# But What About Murph‚Äôs ‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Line?

* Some might argue that Murph‚Äôs line about Brand¬†**‚Äúsettling in for the long sleep‚Äù**¬†means Brand entered¬†**cryo-sleep**, placing that scene in the present.
* But Murph‚Äôs comment could just be¬†**speculation**¬†‚Äî she has¬†**no real way of knowing**¬†Brand‚Äôs status. It‚Äôs likely meant to be¬†**symbolic**, not literal, leaving Brand‚Äôs fate¬†**open to interpretation**‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs where this theory kicks in.

# Additional Points on Murph‚Äôs ‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Line:

1. **Murph Couldn‚Äôt Have Known Brand‚Äôs Status**: She was on Cooper Station,¬†**light-years away**¬†from Edmunds‚Äô planet. Her comment is likely a¬†**poetic guess**, not fact.
2. **‚ÄúLong Sleep‚Äù Might Mean Death**: think about the timing. It‚Äôs been¬†**80+ years**¬†since Brand landed on Edmunds‚Äô planet. Why would she¬†***just now***¬†be going into cryo-sleep? That line could actually be¬†**Murph‚Äôs poetic way of acknowledging Brand‚Äôs possible death**. ‚ÄúLong sleep‚Äù has often symbolized death in films and literature, and Murph, being on her deathbed herself, might simply be¬†**accepting Brand‚Äôs fate**¬†‚Äî and from an emotional angle,¬†**it makes more sense she meant death**. Murph herself was dying and could be acknowledging Brand‚Äôs likely fate.
3. **Line Doesn‚Äôt Confirm the Scene‚Äôs Timeline**: Murph‚Äôs ambiguous wording¬†**doesn‚Äôt prove**¬†the scene is in the present, keeping the theory¬†**viable**.

# My Takeaway:

* I think the scene is right after Cooper's sacrifice, not in the present. Her being young and no time dilation make it impossible for it to be 80 years later.

# What Do You Think?

Have others thought of this before? I haven‚Äôt seen this theory anywhere ‚Äî I could be the only one, but I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts, counter-theories, or plot holes I missed.

# TL;DR:

Dr. Brand is way too¬†**young**¬†in the final scene for it to be¬†**80 years after Cooper‚Äôs sacrifice**. Edmunds‚Äô planet¬†**doesn‚Äôt have time dilation**, so I think that scene is¬†**right after he fell into the black hole**¬†‚Äî meaning Cooper might find her¬†**dead or with a massive colony**, depending on how her mission went.",2025-03-18 11:11:24,0,0,-0.9902,-1,-1,1.0

1245,interstellar,"The juxtaposition of Dr. Mann and Cooper

I recently got to watch Interstellar in IMAX during its anniversary run and I was totally blown away by everything the movie has to offer. I want to make this post to share a viewpoint of mine regarding the characters - the juxtaposition of Dr. Mann and Cooper.

Mann was repeatedly touted as the best the world has to offer. He mentions that he has no attachment on earth (no family) and he chose to participate in operation Lazarus. In this case, Mann represents an archetype of the hero who believes in noble ideas and is willing to sacrifice himself for the betterment of mankind. 

Cooper on the other hand has family. They are the reason he went on the trip, not to save the world but to save his family. He has attachments and people he cares about. All the way, he insisted on going back to earth to see his family. Thus, Coop is somewhat the opposite of Mann. He has attachments while Mann does not, he fights for the people he personally cares about while Mann fights for the idea of mankind.

However, this juxtaposition played out quite differently than imagined. The noble, mankind representative Mann betrayed his mission, reporting in false data in order to be saved while the somewhat ""selfish"" Cooper ultimately made the choice to sacrifice himself in order to save mankind. 

This, in my opinion, shows how having something concrete reason to fight for (your family, loved ones) is more powerful than fighting for some lofty ideas (for mankind). It is easy to talk big, to gloat about noble ideas but in the end it is the personal attachments that make us the strongest. Like how a soldier isn't fighting for his country, he is fighting for his family and loved ones. 

It reminds me of a quote: "" Patriotism does not start out as the love for one's country. It starts as the love for one's family, one's street, one's neighborhood"".",2025-03-18 03:50:07,63,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

But due to my outstation work I had to go to Bhopal and he had to go banglore so we decided TOGETHER that we both won't watch it and will wait for rerelase even though I waited so many years n there was an opportunity to go with my colleagues to watch it 

Now currently I am back to Mumbai and he is still at Bangalore and when I heard again that Interstellar is re-releasing I didn't even think for a second to watch' it here because we promised each other and he wasn't here
 
But today my bf told me he is going out for a movie with his Best friend as he was visiting banglore and I had asked him which movie he was going to watch and he avoided saying they were getting late and I did ask him again and he avoided it, then I questioned him over chat (suspiciously) and he sent me a picture saying that I will get angry and damn he was watching Interstellar!!

And he called me when the intervel was going on and then I saw the pic he sent me. And he started saying sorry and saying that his best friend booked those tickets but ofc he HAD AN OPTION TO SAY NO OR CANCEL IT BUT OFC HE DIDNT.

Sooo after ignoring his 6-7 misscalls I have decided to watch it alone and not wait for a single day because I am going to do what I waited for years. So tomorrow I am watching it as a solo date but confused about the 4dx or IMAX 2d ??

I love this movie, but let me be a little critical of the end and see if people disagree:

Why is there a giant museum of the ‚Äúfarming‚Äù days on the space station? Weren‚Äôt these things constructed in a rush to save humanity from starvation? Isn‚Äôt it established that it takes about 2 years to get to Saturn? Do these people really need a museum to the doom they were living under just two years ago complete with a replica of the chief scientist‚Äôs childhood house? Aren‚Äôt they about to enter the wormhole in these massive untested space stations for the first time? 

Why does everyone treat cooper like a stupid asshole and not a hero of humanity? The doctors are clowning on him for thinking the station might be named after him, and his own family (presumably grandchildren and great grandchildren) treat him like a pariah and display a total lack of awe about the situation. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been a better and more realistic ending to have everyone treating him like a hero and wanting to ask questions but instead he still flys off to meet Brand?

All of these is overshadowed by the beauty of his reunion with Murph and his determination to meet Brand ‚Äúby the light of our new sun‚Äù but on a second watch that whole part feels off.  ",2025-03-17 07:22:32,45,0,0.9827,1,1,1.0

I've seen the enemies-to-BFFs arc between TARS and Cooper discussed a few times in this sub, but I think there‚Äôs more to it. I think there's a bit of misdirection or false-foreshadowing (is there a word for that?) involving TARS and CASE.

When the crew first arrives at the Endurance and begins turning the lights on etc, the vibe is pretty uneasy. As far as I remember, CASE hasn‚Äôt been mentioned up to this point. When TARS finds and activates CASE, it's kind of eerie. At this point, we don't yet fully trust TARS, and now TARS has an ally on board. It's like, oh shit, there's two of them! 

I think there's an implication here that the crew is heading toward a classic human-robot conflict, but that never happens - quite the opposite.

I know that most of us don't want a sequel because it'll ruin a perfect movie and I tend to agree with that.

My idea is basically spin off of the original plot of Interstellar but not in the same universe. 

The idea is:

Crop blight is making it impossible for humans to live on earth. NASA sends a mission to space with Plan A and Plan B, plan a never works because the whole black hole thing doesn't happen, so the crew members inhabit and populate a planet in another galaxy. 

Meanwhile, in a shocking plot twist one of two things happen. Either the people back on earth somehow figure out how to solve the blight or the earth somehow heals itself, the bottom line being  humanity is now flourishing on earth again.

The main storyline would be about the two completely separate human races meeting somehow in the future. I don't know what happens next but I'm curious what you think of this idea?",2025-03-11 03:00:56,0,0,0.4937,1,1,1.0

1316,interstellar,"Interstellar - The Larger Message

I‚Äôve had a distinctive web of thoughts clogged up in my mind for the past couple of days and did not know how or where to express it, so bear with me.

I actually did not get a chance to see Interstellar when it was initially released back in 2014, but thankfully, I got a chance to watch it on an IMAX 70mm screen when it was re-released in December. To say it was mind-blowing would be an understatement‚Äîit‚Äôs what I‚Äôd describe as cinematic hypnotism. Beyond the spellbinding visuals and the transcendent score, my takeaway from the film was that Nolan tried to convey a very heartfelt message about how love is able to transcend time and space, which was what most people thought about it as well.

However, I came across the first teaser, which I‚Äôd never seen before, a couple of weeks ago. What caught my attention was not only the fact that McConaughey‚Äôs lengthy monologue in this teaser wasn‚Äôt present in the film but also that the message wasn‚Äôt something I picked up on.

""We‚Äôve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments‚Ä¶ These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements‚Ä¶ But we lost all that. And perhaps we‚Äôve just forgotten‚Ä¶ That we are still pioneers. That we‚Äôve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us‚Ä¶ Because our destiny lies above us.""

Half the footage used in the teaser was old, real-life footage showcasing mankind's greatest accomplishments. Nolan didn't reveal anything about the story in this teaser but instead tried to set up the larger message of Interstellar‚Äîthat mankind left greatness behind.

There's a scene earlier in the movie between Donald and Cooper in which they talk about how humans don't dream or aspire to great things anymore. Nolan told the audience right then and there what this movie was about, but I hadn't really thought about it to that extent, appreciating it only as well-written conversational dialogue between two great actors. This isn't the only scene that tries to convey this message, though. There are a few scenes placed cleverly throughout the first act of the film that present a world that has turned inward, abandoning scientific ambition in favor of mere survival.

""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" This dialogue (amazingly delivered by McConaughey) tells us something very meaningful‚Äîhumanity has stopped looking up. It has stopped striving for the extraordinary, settling instead for the ordinary. Cooper's frustration with this mindset reflects the film's overall critique of mediocrity and complacency.

Not to get too personal, but this message resonated with me deeply. Not only did we lose the wonder and ambition we used to have, but as humans, we also tend to mock the few people left who actually aspire to be great. A great example of this is how people responded to Timoth√©e Chalamet's speech a couple of weeks ago (funnily enough, Interstellar was also the film that launched him into Hollywood), calling him arrogant and disrespectful just because he boldly stated his desire to be one of the greats. Only some of us still remember to look up once in a while and have genuine wonder about what our limits are, while the majority look down and only try to get past the day, having left any sort of wonder and imagination behind.

Coming back to the film, I realized Nolan utilized this message as a metaphor for the entire story. The world, depicted as one that has left the desire for greatness and high achievements behind (shown in the scene where schools are now teaching kids that the moon landing was fake), is plagued by a crop blight and is confronted with the possible extinction of its largest species. Interstellar travel, which is a big idea, then becomes both a literal and symbolic solution. It represents the need to push boundaries once again and to embrace curiosity and wonder instead of just enduring. Perhaps this is why the ship is called the Endurance.

I initially thought this was a bit of a reach, but Nolan is known for symbolic names‚Äîlike Ariadne in Inception, the palindromic structure of Tenet, etc. The real-life Endurance, the ship from the infamous Antarctic expedition, ended up getting trapped in ice but has now become a legendary story of perseverance. From what I can gather, this parallel reinforces the film's message about how endurance is not just about holding on but about pushing forward. The film's argument is that survival isn't enough‚Äîwe need to aspire to something greater.

That is exactly why the film's emotional core, particularly the father-daughter relationship, ties into this theme perfectly. Love, like exploration, is a force that transcends time and space.

So yes, Nolan cleverly used the dystopian setting as a metaphor for what happens when we lose ambition and the desire for greatness, and space exploration becomes the ultimate expression of reclaiming it. Interstellar is not just a love letter to space exploration, but a call to rekindle human ambition, and that is something I love and respect. Perhaps this applies to Nolan himself, as venturing into ancient Greek mythology for his forthcoming film, The Odyssey, marks a significant departure from his previous work. Having finally been rewarded for his work on Oppenheimer has seemingly fueled him to aspire to a greater form of storytelling.

I'm sure people have talked about this multiple times before, but these are just some of my thoughts that I had to write down. So thanks if you managed to make it to the end despite the length. I just think it's amazing how there is still so much to analyze in Nolan's films years‚Äîhell, decades‚Äîafter they've been released. Will always line up to watch this man's films on day one.

How do people decide when to leave things alone and when to expand? Personally I see Interstellar as a masterpiece, timeless classic.

However, the universe doesn‚Äôt need to be untouched, and I personally think expanding on the universe would be fun.

The entire plot is that blight is wiping out crops causing a collapse in agriculture and  since the blight thrives on nitrogen, oxygen was being removed due to plant life being wiped out. 

Except one little thing ruins the plot. One little word, algae. Most oxygen comes from algae, the ocean's ecosystem depends on algae not land plants. 

Earth's plants are being wiped out by blight? Stockpile as much seed as possible every day of every year and let the blight burn itself out, then after research, start crop  re-introduction . In the meantime setup land based algae cultivation for land locked regions, and coastal areas focus on large scale fish farms. 

The plot around nitrogen replacing oxygen is non-sensical as most oxygen comes from the oxygen.

1363,interstellar,"Nothing about the plot makes sense

The initial problem is blight: Earth is becoming uninhabitable due to an unstoppable fungi/bacteria/whatever outcompeting plants for nitrogen, essentially. Solution: find another habitable planet. Good so far, but then it goes off the rails. Every planet they go to is worse than Earth. Soil is alive, and these planets are all dead. So you need to bring your own soil, which means you need to somehow remove the blight without killing the good bacteria, which has nothing whatsoever to do with space travel. If you have the ability to do that then you can just build a sealed agricultural environment on Earth. Who cares if there's a planet with water through the wormhole? We have plenty of water here already.

But it gets worse. After jumping from McGuffin to McGuffin in the form of vaguely-defined ""data"" (and seriously, why risk your life to get the data on Miller's planet? How much proof do you need that you can't live there?), Cooper goes for the *real* important data in the black hole. With it, humanity gains mastery over gravity. Hooray! Now they can colonize the ice planet through the wormhole. Except...they immediately prove they don't need to. It turns out they *could* build perfectly self-contained, self-sufficient biomes. They use the gravity McGuffin to move them to orbit near Saturn, but that was just for show. Once they're able to create working biodomes the problem that kicked off the movie is solved. Furthermore, once the gravity data is sent, there is no need to go through the wormhole again, since we now have access to the entire solar system of resources. There's nothing in the Gargantua system that we can't get more easily from the Sol system.

I don't mind the liberties taken with science, but this movie is all over the place with the actual point of the plot. Somebody says we need to get X to do Y and that's that, we can't ask any further questions. In the end Cooper gets the data, so humanity is saved. The mechanics of it are handwaved away. Humans were on the brink, but because of one singular scientific breakthrough they now live in a techno-utopia. The Earth was screwed because it was going to be lifeless soon, but now that we've reached the lifeless orbit of Saturn everything is fine. As if to drive home the point that they didn't care about worldbuilding beyond what it allows them to do visually, Cooper station is rotating to produce gravity, even though *we just mastered gravity.* Don't ask questions, O'Neill cylinders are cool!

Anyway, thanks for reading. This has bothered me for a while. It's a fun movie to watch but I always found the plot annoying.",2025-03-05 16:27:49,0,0,0.8181,1,1,1.0
1364,interstellar,"Tesseract Question

So when Cooper says the tesseract was created by humans in the future, that part left me a bit confused. Does he mean other humans? Like humans in another galaxy that have evolved more than us? Or does he mean us, as humans, in the future? Because the latter doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. How could we have evolved enough to do such a thing if we all died on Earth? Because we‚Äôd be dead of that wormhole never opens, and so there is a catch-22 there. What do you all think? I have to assume he meant ‚Äúother‚Äù humans who figured out time travel, wormholes, etc who went back, figured out what was happening and decided our human species needed saving. 

Edit: read a few of the common responses to it. Will need to actually read some of the theory behind this to understand it better. Thanks!",2025-03-05 14:17:01,4,0,-0.4857,-1,-1,1.0

I just finished watching the series and the only thing I could think of was that the fianl message is somehow related to Interstellar or Neon Genesis Evangelion.

When I say Interstellar, I mean it's structure, because its basiclly a modern myth. But its not only that. In some way both talk about the journey of the hero (el camino del h√©roe, in my language), presented by Joseph Campbell. In the end, Caspian fullfils his journey with Maddie by his side. Lastly and most importantly, both (in my opinion) share a common concept, which is how humans are their own gods. That is the paradox presented in both cinematographic masterpieces.

Next, Evangelion, which is pretty  obvious from the beggining since Maddie has a sticker on her laptop that represents the symbol of NERV in Evangelion. Somewhere I read that Pantheon is a modern Evangelion, and they are right. From a psicological point of view both series present how each character has to overcome his own problems which ends up connecting with the whole show. For Evangelionm its the instrumentallity project, for Pantheon, the UI. Moving on, you could say they end up the same way, main characters have the opportunity to lets say ""reach"" a divine existance, but they turn it down.

They both talk about the creation of all what we know and the overcoming of our problems. All 3 also enphazise on how important the connection between humans are. I would also like to remember that all this is simplly my opinion. What is yours?",2025-03-04 18:15:53,9,0,0.9839,1,1,1.0

1375,interstellar,"Arrival (2016) and Interstellar (2014) Cross-Over

I recently watched Arrival (2016), and couldn't help but think if learning the heptapod's language: to experience time as non-linear, could explain how ""they"" (humans in the future) helped Cooper in his voyage to find a habitable planet and save humanity. 

Due to this gift, humans can see the ""future"" only if they have learned the language well enough. While Arrival took place in the present and Interstellar in mid 21st Century, it would have taken only a few years before the ""Universal Language"" was published and not enough time to learn it fully until the world faces famine and collapsing governments. This divide could have costed the world's attention to bring food to the table and not to explorations or learning alien language. However, there are chances that the language is still learnt by a few people and have gained the ability to see time as non-linear. 

In Interstellar, ""they"" placed a tesseract specifically in Gargantua to save Cooper and as a way for him to understand a new dimension of time in a physical sense. So, it made sense how it was possible for Cooper to shake hands with Brand when they went through the wormhole earlier in the movie since Cooper was interacting with ""past"" time in a physical dimension. It's also worth noting that in Murphy's Law: ""Anything that could go wrong will go wrong"" should explain that the past can't be changed to change the present or future, same concept with Arrival which leans on to a fixed timeline theory of being unable to change the past but only experience time in one. This theory could explain that while ""they"" couldn't physically travel in the past, ""they"" used gravity and higher-dimensional physics to manipulate space-time to create the wormhole and tesseract. (crazy how it's a time loop)

Lastly, the heptapods needs humanity in the future (after 3,000 years), so ""they"" needed Murph to solve the gravity equation and save humanity from extinction as a way to repay the gift that the heptapods have given to humans.

I‚Äôm a college student, an astrophysics major. I first saw Interstellar ten years ago. I was eleven, and I didn‚Äôt have the media literacy or scientific knowledge to enjoy the film to its fullest extent (of course, I‚Äôm still learning, even today). I didn‚Äôt even finish it‚ÄîI was half-asleep and went to my room for the night while the others finished the movie. 

I watched it again recently, so excited for it to be my ‚Äúreal‚Äù first time. The thing is, though, things have changed in my life. Almost a year and a half ago, I learned that I was donor-conceived. It was an egg donor, my mom‚Äîthe woman who bore me and raised me‚Äîis not genetically related to me. My genetic mother (I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbiological‚Äù here‚Äîbirth *is* biology) is a stranger. The process was anonymous. Anyway, I‚Äôve been thinking of the film since I watched it, and I‚Äôve seen parallels between humanity‚Äôs journey and my own story. 

For me, what happened with my mom‚Äôs eggs is like the Blight that ravages Earth. Humanity is forced to the stars, because the alternative is extinction. I am sure that if you asked the humans on Cooper Station (especially the older ones who had memories of their home planet) the majority would say they would‚Äôve rather stayed on Earth if it hadn‚Äôt gotten so inhospitable. There‚Äôd be some other timeline out there where the Blight never happened, maybe where humankind thrived on Earth (assuming they took better care of it). Similarly, if it weren‚Äôt for the problem with my mom, she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten an egg donor, and I, as I know myself today, would never have existed. There‚Äôs some other world out there, with another child who really is the product of my mom and dad‚Äôs genetic material. I was not that child, though I spent most of my life thinking I was. I only exist because of the problem with my mom‚Äôs fertility, just as everyone born on Cooper Station, Edmund‚Äôs Planet, or anywhere else beyond the Earth owes their being to the tragedy that befell their ancestral home. 

What I also know is that Interstellar is a story of human resiliency, a story where humankind looks extinction in the face and says ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm still alive.‚Äù And I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm alive. The Blight wanted to stop me from existing, but I found a way. I‚Äôm going to live. 

This revelation of mine will continue to hit me in stages, I‚Äôm sure. All I know is I‚Äôm glad I saw that film again. ",2025-02-27 15:04:04,27,0,0.8342,1,1,1.0

1440,interstellar,"My working theory on Love

I will explain my understanding - please point out any flaws:

The wormhole opened up 48 years before Cooper and the crew head up to space. This wormhole was created by them due to their their achieved grasp of gravity (because it is not affected by time). Also, not part of my question, but the fact that they had to bring the wormhole into appearance in the exact timing for everything else to proceed (initiating the program and working toward the Lazarus missions) blew my mind this past viewing in IMAX.

Cooper goes into the tesseract and gives the data from the inside of the black hole (singularity, the missing part of the gravity equation), which makes it way to Murph's watch again through gravity.

My working theory:

All of this is under the umbrella of the truest (or at least highest) dimension of love (what I would say the tesseract / manipulation of gravity was). This is why in Brand's words, ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space,"" is why Cooper could confidently say that ""they"" is them.

To build on that, when the ""first handshake"" happens, gravity is again being manipulated to indicate that love (the ultimate driving force) *may* exist between Cooper and Brand.

Even the timing of the wormhole opening up 48 years earlier means that love ultimately had to be the driving force to create it, since without it there was no access to get data from gargantua or to access the planets.

EDIT: I do believe that the tesseract and manipulation is it's own dimension, but the driving force that allowed the manipulation of that gravity was the love that Cooper had for his daughter, thus making love the highest dimension.",2025-02-24 09:22:49,11,0,0.9911,1,1,1.0

We know that the Lazarus astronauts each went through the wormhole alone, with only a single ship, likely something like a Ranger or a Lander.

It has an entire control station, life-support systems, a robotic assistant (KIPP), and enough space to hold multiple people.

Even if NASA pre-sent the module how? There's no mention of unmanned cargo Landers delivering supplies ahead of time just probes, and sending a massive module across interstellar space wouldn't be simple. From the looks of the habitat module it also doesn't appear to be foldable or inflatable. 

The biggest issue is that even though he had a lander that still doesn't explain the scale. Even if his lander was slightly larger that a ranger, it's hard to believe it had the cargo space for a full size base. He needed to stay there long term but unless NASA had some insane off-screen technology, it doesn't seem possible that he could have transported and deployed a module that big with the resources that he needed to survive for a few years.

I feel that they are orbiting Saturn because they are planning to go through the wormhole that we saw in the start of the movie. Through this, they are trying to go the brand's / Edmund's planet, as that would be the only habitable planet.  
The stations would be made big because I feel many people wouldn't want to spend their times in cryosleep. However this comes at some faults, going through the wormhole will let's just say be a experience for the people.  
We heard Murph say that Dr. Brand is setting up her base at our new home, under our new sun.  
This just proves that they are taking all the people to brand's planet.  
The reason Cooper had to leave was because he just couldn't see his own child die, as murph said.

There's a lot of pretense in movies, intentional or otherwise, but regardless of the incoming wave being for a dramatic moment, Cooper probably had less fear about the data being destroyed or lost by another wave than Brand and Doyle did.

Brand and Doyle, out there in the moment, feared losing it forever, regardless of there being data from other sources. If Brand had just turned back to the shuttle in time for liftoff, Cooper could have just flown over the wave and they could have just scanned for the parts again. Sure there's a chance it could have scattered too far, but... I'm siding with Cooper's distant cool head over Brand's in-the-moment panic. Doyle would have made it back sooner if Brand hadn't continued to the data module, so I'm considering him saved by following Cooper's lead completely.

When this came out in 2014, we had absolutely no idea what we was walking into. I remember this night vividly. 

I was in my mid 20's in good health. Brand new Lexus, brand new Bathing Ape WGM purple camo hoodie, brand new pair of Air Jordans ( Retro 4 ) smoking hot girlfriend, we went in a group of 13 people. Everyone coupled up. It was amazing. 

After the movie ended everyone was SILENT üòé. We went to the chillies across the parking lot for dinner & that's when we blew up in conversations. We was there for damn near 2 hours & a huge bill. Talking Theories etc. 

My lady & I was so impressed, that we went to see it again the following day but this time closer to home at our local AMC IMAX theater. Was still confused. 

We saw it again 11 years later. Same group, same couples. We all just got old & fat & balding üòÇ. We all got mortgages now.

1525,interstellar,"Isolation: Dr. Romilly vs Dr. Mann

I just spontaneously rewatched this masterpiece (not for the last time!), and among all the thoughts swirling in my head, I noticed there's a (maybe not so) subtle foil created early on between Romilly and Mann. I've commented on this before, but I never realized to what degree it was set up and wanted to make a post.

From the beginning, we're told Mann is the best of humanity, etc - even before he appears on screen, you get the feeling he's charismatic, a natural leader, just from how everyone talks about him. Conversely, Romilly is set up as quirky, kind of a nerd. They make a point of him showing 'weakness' early on, both physically in getting motion sickness and mentally when Cooper reassures him with the yachtsman analogy. 

Yet, when they are similarly tested, doomed to never interact with another human for the rest of their lives (so far as they know), Romilly handles it astoundingly well, keeping up with his research, and just generally staying level. His reaction to them returning was somber, but he didn't break down or become anywhere near as unstable as Mann.
(To be fair, I think Mann is unfairly maligned - truly, few of us who judge him have probably ever been or ever will be tested like he was, but that's a different discussion.)",2025-02-17 00:39:13,124,0,0.919,1,1,1.0

1531,interstellar,"Still one question the movie never answers. Why did Murphy Cooper destroy Joseph Cooper's lander and then blame a ""ghost""? This doesn't comes up again and is never explained.

If you all can recall, in one of the movies first scenes, Murph brings a replica of the Apollo 11 lander downstairs to the breakfast table before school. I'm not gonna get into the immaturity it takes to do something like this, especially since this was a school day with a parent teacher conference. Parent, not grandparent at that, but I digress. Every time I rewatch this movie, the most perplexing part of it isn't the tesseract scene or the way Doyle yells at the silly rectangular robot to rescue Anne Hathaway from two feet of water (she clearly could have gotten up if she wanted to). The scene that confuses me the most is breakfast at the Cooper farm just before herbicide 101. It's a brief scene, but it may be the most significant of the movie. 

Murphy brings down the broken lander that she obviously destroyed, but rather than owning up to it like an adult would, she instead opts to lie and say a ""ghost"" knocked it off her shelf.

Yeah, *sure* Murph.

My question is, why did Murph lie so early in the movie and how come it's never addressed? What did Christopher Nolan mean by including that scene in the final cut rather than reserving it for the blu-ray deleted scenes tab? I actually have a theory about this, but I'm not a big movie theorist so please bare with me. 

Murphy Cooper is an abuser and regularly lashes out at her father both mentally and physically. The lander was clearly sentimental to Cooper, which is likely part of the reason Murph chose this as an object to destroy. Cooper loved this lander, therefore in her brain this would hurt him. This would also explain why Murph grinds third gear and sabotoges one of the 2014 Ram 3500 4x4 dually's tires with the knowledge that there was no spare. Her neglectful father pays her no mind, so one of the only ways she can get his attention is by breaking his stuff that is important to him and mocking him for his PTSD episodes from the crash (hence the scene right after Cooper's dream).

What's great but also very sad about this scene is that Cooper knows she's lying and only plays into her silly lie when Donald gives him that worried look. Clearly this has happened before. This is made apparent when Timoth√©e Chalamet is so willing to call out Murph on her lie, even as far as to call her a ""dumb ass"", which is rude, however understandable given the circumstances and context. With the stressors of herbicide 101 fresh on his mind, Timoth√©e Chalamet is finally fed up with Murph's public vitriolic hatred she displays to her father and is the only family member willing to say out loud what Cooper, Donald and Boots must also be thinking. Murph is clearly a troubled child and the movie is practically screaming it in our faces the entire time, meanwhile Cooper is a neglectful father. He rewards this dysfunctional behavior with getting her suspended from school to watch a baseball game that doesn't even have any hotdogs, which is unnatural.

Something most people don't consider is that Timoth√©e Chalamet has had a first hand view into Murph's neurotic behavior for her father's attention. This is made clear to us when Cooper is pulling up to the school after stopping at the asian fighter plane store. He knows she's in trouble and even laughs hysterically because it must happen so often. She quite literally got into a fist fight over one of Cooper's old federal textbooks. One's that had already been replaced by the corrected versions. After witnessing this first hand, it's clear that Timoth√©e Chalamet is trying to defend his father's honor and bring order back to the Cooper household before it's too late, hence the bravery. Unfortunately, he fails and Cooper ends up traveling quite literally across space and time just to get away from his abusive daughter. 

It's really unfortunate, but luckily they're able to make ammends because of a watch they both like or something. Mind you, a watch, that at one point, Murph threw across the room in one of her many fits of rage and disdain for her father. 

What's odd is that this is never harkoned back to or explained after Cooper leaves. Why is that? 

Wnat are yalls thoughts on the matter? How do you interpret Murph's lie and the subsequent plot device simply being dropped altogether? What did Murph mean when she said a ghost broke the lander? Why is she blaming her own wrongdoings on a ghost? Does she mean her mother?  ",2025-02-16 15:58:01,0,0,-0.9965,-1,-1,1.0

I caught a flight to Dallas and listened to ""No Time For Caution"" (the score from the docking scene over Mann's planet) during takeoff then I realized that is probably the closest I will ever get to recreating (lol) that scene. Also I'd eaten a THC gummy beforehand. 

The factors of rapidly experiencing G forces (albeit way less G forces) compiled with the stakes of flying in the US currently. The state of American Aviation is very shaky currently. So even though the fate of all humans wasn't uncertain, my fate was. Lol

I didn't know how long it would take the plane to drive from the hangar to the runway, so I kept restarting the score (lolol) when I would realize I wouldn't time the climax with the takeoff.

Finally the plane quickly accelerated as the score hit the climax. I ""timed it perfectly"".... My hearts pace quickened. The gummy made me feel every bit of G forces and anxiety. 

As we lifted off from the ground, the strings and piano were going crazy and the lights on the ground started fading. Then the howling organ took over for the finale, as we pushed to our cruising altitude in the higher levels of the atmosphere. Similarly to Coop pushing the Endurance out of the Mann planet's atmosphere.

I really don't think this one gets as much love as it deserves. I think it's because it's somewhat stagnant and not necessarily super interesting to listen to on its own, but it fits in beautifully with the scene. The warm, peaceful chords and barely-perceptible synth motif above perfectly accompany the closing of the tesseract and Cooper's ""whathappensnow"". It feels transcendent, especially when most of the instruments cut away while we go back to Saturn and there are just these almost naked-sounding, ascending chords. The scene has always felt like a little bit of a metaphor for death (Cooper feeling at peace, the ""light at the end of the tunnel"") and this song sounds like what it would feel like to die.

1542,interstellar,"Watched Interstellar for the first time in Theatres and it didn't hit me like I thought it would.

Please read the full post.

I wanted to love this movie so much but after leaving the theatres, I only felt it was okay at best. Part of it has to do with me already having been spoiled on some reveals by being on the internet whether it be through the memes or someone casually talked about it, explaining something in an yt video, post or reels, etc. But still, I thought if it's a well-made movie I would enjoy it regardless. But unfortunately, that didn't happen.

The parts I was spoiled on were Cooper being the ghost and seeing Murph grow up unable to do anything and something tragic happening (The Cooper crying scene in the memes) and the ""This manoeuvre is going to cost us \_\_ years"" meme.

Maybe because of being spoiled, the scenes in the movie didn't hit especially the emotional ones. I really wanted to get invested in Coop, Murph and the others story emotionally but just couldn't in any way.

The soundtrack was great, and the space scenes were really cool and looked really nice in the big screen.

My favourite scene had to be the one where Coop reattaches their ship to the spiralling station that's going down and then taking back control of it. The tension there was so high, off the roofs and the soundtrack there was chef‚Äôs kiss.

A scene that I didn't feel good about was the monologue by Dr Brand about love. I kept thinking at the back of my head, that u are going to leave the fate of all humanity on love? You are a scientist, and u should make think and take logical decisions here, but I feel like that was the point and Nolan was trying to tell us about the power was love but that scene didn't really work imo.

Some more stuff I didn't enjoy were feeling like there were potholes like how cooper and TAARS created a fifth fucking dimension to rescue themselves and then closed it themselves (It *was too high sci-fi and not enough time to explain a lot of stuff. Felt like this movie would have been better if was longer and had more character interactions and scenes to cook up the emotional beats more and other exposition scenes*) and some bad decisions were made and there should have been consequences but I guess the movie is more about the emotional stuff so I will stop.

Main thing is that it didn't hit me, and I feel that's an essentially part of this movie. I know it's a me problem and this isn't a hate post, quite the contrary. I can see why this movie is so loved and I made this post to just talk about the movie with people. I don't really have that many friends to talk about it.

The ending was a bit unsatisfactory for me I would have to say. I thought I already knew the ending. Copper was going to be there trapped forever rewatching his last moments over and over and how he treated Murph and contemplate on his decisions. I was surprised when the movie kept going and they reunited with her being so old and then going to look for Dr Brand. I kept thinking, u are not going to interact with your blood family i.e. your grandchildren and their children and neither are going to interact with him too? and, the humans now have so powerful tech that they can rescue Coop but not Dr Brand? I felt like she should have been rescued first, no? And certainly, Coop will rescue her easy-peasy because of the tech so what was the point was ending there? Shouldn't they have reunited and end with them together in a farm? That should have been a better ending if u ask me, but I digress.

I usually post my thoughts and discuss it in subreddits whether it's a media I watched or a game I played, and this post was made with that intention. So, now the question, what did u guys think about the movie and how did u perceived it when u first watched it?

I want to know about people's story who watched it for the first time blind and their experience. How it became your fav movie and how much u would rate it if it's not your fav. Personally, would say it's a 6. SORRY. I intend to do a rewatch in the future with better sound. The theatre sound I felt was a bit low to my taste.

Have to say, I was surprised to see who were in this movie except Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain. Those 2 I knew. But Timoth√©e Chalamet, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Topher Grace¬†and finally Wes Bentley. I kept thinking where I have seen Wes Bentley and after I googled him, I realized OH! he was in the first Hunger Game and its Yellowstone whose only 2 episode I have watched. These casting were a real surprise. Wasn't expecting so many big names to show up.

Anyways, thank you for reading and please don't downvote me. I am sure some of u have the same experience with some other media that u got spoiled and didn't hit as much even though u were desperately wanting to like it. I just want to talk about the movie and let‚Äôs do that in the comments. I will also maybe keep editing the post to add more stuff that comes to my mind about the movie. That's it.

Hope the mods don't delete it.

¬†**EDIT after 2 hours of browsing Interstellar related stuff:** 

After reading several posts and a bunch of paragraphs of explanations , deep dives and themes , I will have to admit, I missed a lot of the sciency stuff. But the main reason why I feel like I didn't connect with this movie is because of Love. 

I did not feel the love between Coop and Murph. I know it may seem obvious, but it's a major factor I think. Controversial you might say, but I did not feel the love between the 2 actors. I know it's a me thing and others are definitely not going to agree but love is subjective and I guess I wasn't in the right mood to sob or feel the love. My heart wasn't open this time. 

I will for sure give it a rewatch in the future and really hope to get the "" I GET IT NOW MOMENT "" this time.",2025-02-15 21:19:17,0,0,0.9992,1,1,1.0

The docking scene is one of those rare cinematic moments where tension, emotion, and awe come together in a way that few films ever manage to achieve. Even knowing how it plays out, it still leaves me on edge every time. There‚Äôs something about the urgency of the situation, the space station tumbling out of control, and Cooper trying to align the ships with such precision. It's the rawness of that human desire to survive, to make it work against all odds, and the uncertainty that comes with it. 

The anxiety in the scene, for me, stems from the chaos of everything happening so fast and the extreme focus required. It‚Äôs not just the physical danger of the docking, but also the emotional weight ‚Äì the pressure Cooper feels, the impact on the crew, and the stakes for humanity itself. You know the outcome, but the tension is still so real. It‚Äôs as if the universe itself is trying to prevent them from succeeding, and yet you want to believe they can pull it off.

The music is a huge part of why I love it. The music made me feel like I was in that moment with Cooper, Amelia Brand, and TARS. The music drives that sense of anxiety in you and makes you want Cooper to successfully dock to the endurance, but it also fills you with a strange sense of hope, as if there's something greater waiting on the other side of that chaos. The swell of the music as Cooper gets closer to docking, paired with the visual effects, feels like a journey both of survival and of the human spirit. It's powerful.

It‚Äôs not really a plot hole, but still. 

I get that they weren‚Äôt anticipating a loss of 23 years, but even the best case scenario would‚Äôve cost *at least* months or years, no? And in any case, with at least the risk of losing so much time, why not send off a message to Earth about what they were going to do, so the folks back home have an idea of what‚Äôs happening, even if they don‚Äôt get synchronous updates.

Questions I still have about Dr. Mann-

1. He has gone into hibernation and is still pinging the thumbs up in hopes that someone will come and rescue him from his loneliness, death. But when they do, he escapes to the Endurance with the intention of ""completing the mission"". How would he know that Edmund's planet isn't more of the same? If it means going back to Earth, he's surely deduced that the Earth is fucked by now.

  
2. He rigs Kip to blow up in case someone tries to access the archives, and in process kills Romilly, felt like such an abrupt, cheap death for him, just after he met his gang 24 years later :(. How does blowing up Kip make sense? It could easily turn out that the archival access happens when Dr. Mann is nearby. 

  
3. This is kind of a lame question but I'll ask it anyway - how does the pioneer of the mission open the air hatch when it's not even docked? I get that he's hurried and anxious and scared. But he has an intricate understanding of space, he is an astronaut after all.

  
Also kind of a side question - is the Endurance that Dr. Mann, Edmund, Miller came in orbiting Edmund's planet as it should be the last they visit?

Since Edmunds‚Äô planet has similar time dilation to Earth (no supermassive black hole nearby), why doesn‚Äôt Brand age as much as Murph does? If years passed for Murph while she was solving the equation and building ships, shouldn‚Äôt Brand have aged significantly too?

In Interstellar, ""they"" are initially thought to be advanced beings guiding humanity. However, Cooper‚Äôs realization‚Äî""They didn't bring us here, we brought ourselves.""‚Äîsuggests something far more mind-bending: Cooper and TARS are ‚Äúthey.‚Äù

The Theory (mine)

1. Timeline 1 - The Origin

Cooper-1 and TARS-1 enter the black hole.
Due to extreme time dilation, they remain trapped for millennia. Over time, they evolve or discover how to manipulate higher dimensions. They create the Tesseract, allowing their past selves to escape.



2. Timeline 2 - The Intervention

Cooper-1 and TARS-1 place the Tesseract inside Gargantua. They interact with their past selves (Cooper-2 and TARS-2), guiding them out. This sacrifices Timeline 1, ensuring the loop continues.



3. A Self-Sustaining Time Loop

Every version of Cooper and TARS relies on a previous iteration to survive. There were never any ‚Äúhigher beings‚Äù helping‚Äîjust future versions of themselves ensuring the cycle perpetuates.

Why This Makes Sense
It resolves the bootstrap paradox: The knowledge comes from a past Cooper who spent eons inside the black hole.

It aligns with the movie‚Äôs core theme: time is a physical dimension that humans can manipulate.

The quote supports it: ‚ÄúWe brought ourselves‚Äù suggests no divine intervention‚Äîjust humanity guiding itself.

In essence, Cooper and TARS aren‚Äôt just surviving the loop‚Äîthey ARE the loop.

So I'm hoping that I'm not guilty of overlooking an answer that's in the film. Interstellar is an unquestionable masterpiece, in my opinion. I've watched it more times than I can count. But there's always been one nagging detail that I couldn't quite square away: how did Murphy know that Brand was alone on Edmunds' planet? It seemed to me that she was implying Cooper should go ""be"" with her. But that would also imply that she was aware of some type of romance between Brand, and Cooper that the movie never hints at. I know I'm making another assumption on this, but that would then imply that Murphy had knowledge of Edmunds passing away before Brand's arrival. Also, was Murphy in cryo-sleep for two years prior to Cooper being found, or was she put into cryo-sleep for the journey from her station to Cooper's? If prior, why?

1647,interstellar,"Interstellar is NOT a Time Loop or Paradox‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Why

There is often a misconception in this subreddit that Interstellar‚Äôs plot uses a time loop or a grandfather paradox. I get why people lean that way‚Äîit‚Äôs a complex film with mind-bending concepts‚Äîbut that interpretation doesn‚Äôt hold up when you break down the science and narrative logic. Let me explain.

First, we need to rethink how we perceive time. Time is:

1. Not linear 
2. A construct humans use to describe our experience of the universe moving through space-time.

We experience time as a linear progression moving from past to present to future. But that‚Äôs just our perception, not the true nature of time. According to Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, time is part of a four-dimensional fabric called space-time. Events don‚Äôt ‚Äúhappen‚Äù one after the other in some cosmic queue; instead, they all exist simultaneously on this fabric, much like locations on a map.

Think of it this way: people often say God exists ‚Äúoutside of time,‚Äù meaning He isn‚Äôt bound by time‚Äôs progression. He can see the past, present, and future all at once, like looking at the whole map rather than walking along a path. In Interstellar, the fifth-dimensional beings (the future humans) perceive time similarly in that they can see all points in time simultaneously but even though they can perceive time in this non-linear way, they struggle to navigate it in a way that influences specific outcomes. That‚Äôs where Cooper comes in‚Äîthey needed a modern human perspective to interact with time in a meaningful way, using gravity as a means to access the past.

Okay so my main point is: many argue that Cooper giving himself the NASA coordinates or sending the quantum data to Murph is evidence of a time loop or a paradox. But it‚Äôs not. This isn‚Äôt a closed causal loop where the events can‚Äôt exist without themselves (like the grandfather paradox, where going back in time to change something would prevent the time travel from happening in the first place).

Instead, Interstellar shows the idea that gravity is the only force that can transcend dimensions, including time. Cooper doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúchange‚Äù the past, he always *was* the ghost in Murph‚Äôs room. From a higher-dimensional perspective, this isn‚Äôt a loop or a paradox; it‚Äôs a fixed event in space-time. Cooper‚Äôs actions were always part of the timeline. It‚Äôs only from our limited, linear viewpoint that it seems like a loop or paradox.

TLDR: the film isn‚Äôt about time looping back on itself or paradoxes, it‚Äôs about transcending our perception of time, and how love and gravity can connect us across vast distances in both space and time.",2025-02-08 23:11:05,0,0,0.7985,1,1,1.0

Occasionally I come back for more assignments and can see he's still watching it. Later though, I come in just when Cooper was spit out of the tesseract and is in the wormhole, encountering Amelia while he exists in the bulk.

With *Interstellar*‚Äôs 10th-anniversary re-release in theaters, I‚Äôve seen a surge of excitement from the community. It‚Äôs incredible to see so many people revisiting this masterpiece on the big screen as it was meant to be experienced. However, I‚Äôve also noticed an increase in posts showing photos and videos taken during theatrical screenings.

Effective immediately, **I am banning all posts containing images or videos taken inside the theater during a screening**.

# Why this rule?

**Respect for the cinematic experience!** *Interstellar* was designed for the big screen, and part of its magic is in the immersion. Taking photos or videos during a screening disrupts that experience for others.

# Why am I adding this rule now?

During the first re-release, I didn‚Äôt enforce this rule because it was just temporary event, lasting only a week. However, with *Interstellar*‚Äôs extended theatrical run and its return in multiple countries, it‚Äôs clear that re-releases are becoming more frequent. Given this trend, I expect more showings in the future, and I want to establish a clear standard now. By setting this rule, I‚Äôm ensuring that our community continues to respect the theatrical experience and the integrity of the film for all future screenings.

I saw Interstellar today in Cinema. An experience that cannot be worded. I first watched it while I was in class 8th. And I remember the spark I had within myself back then. 

I was so obsessed with Astronomy and astrophysics back then. I loved reading about Universe and Space. I watched TV shows like ""How the Universe works"" and ""Cosmos"". I was in love with this. I made a diary where I wrote down these fascinating facts. I joined Facebook groups related to astronomy and it was so fun. I even made my own theories about Black hole, accretion disk, shape of singularity and the event horizon. All this while I was 14-16. I wanted to be a part of this. Be an astronomer or Physicist. I learnt about String theory, multiverse theory, etc. 


But somewhere along the line, I lost this passion. Life struck me. Joined the rat race of engineering. Competitive exams, body dysmorphia, face dysmorphia, struggles with my own sexuality, family issues, p*rn addiction, masturb@tion addiction, college, alcohol, weed. 


And when I watched the movie today, seeing those scenes again, listening to that music again made me remember my old self. How things could have been. My first love that I had for astronomy could never be accomplished. ",2025-02-07 21:09:03,13,0,0.9312,1,1,1.0

and since time travel is out of the question here, time travel to the past cannot exist either. then how did the humans from the future place the tesseract in the past.

Interstellar originally released in 2014.

I was a broke student back in those times and could not attend the theatrical release here in my city in india. 

However, i watched the movie on laptop several times. 

Back in 2023, prior to Oppenheimer release several notable Nolan movies were re run in the theatres in my city including Interstellar. 

I had the chance to watch any one film (not possible to watch all the films during the limited re run due to obvious showtime and money constraints)

and I had picked The Dark Knight to watch.

That dream of watching TDK in the theater was fulfilled in 2023.

Now, finally for the decade anniversary Interstellar is again re running in India.

Today I watched Interstellar in the theater in 2025 February. 

Always wanted to see those segments of the film such as travel near gargantuan, tesseract navigation and wormhole travel on the bigger screen of theatre accompanied by the beautiful music of Hans Zimmer through the theater sound system.

It is such a visual and auditory treat. 

Although the screen was not IMAX but nonetheless a dream of watching this cinematic art in a theatre screen got fulfilled. 

It was such a surreal experience.

I was I want to appreciate number of things they went on lengths to make this happen for us:

* They tried hard to persuade the higher ups (Cinemark or IMAX) to extend the run at Cinemark 17 believing in our interest in the movie, and what it means to us, and that it will sell out, which it did.
* Special shout out to **Louis**, the projectionist, who held the fort after IMAX pulled their projectionist after the planned run. Louis showed the equipment on how delicate it is, and how much goes into perfecting the job of operating it every day.
* The speaker issue on December 7 was not something for which a solution was easy to be found (the speaker literally caught on fire). Even then, they had a quick turnaround to find the replacement parts.
* Right from handling the small film reels (it comes in parts) and putting it together, to taking good care of it, maintain the perfect humidity, is something I absolutely loved learning about.

Thank you everyone at Cinemark who made this happen for us. Please know that we as a community will always support you, are always there to back you, and hope more films are shown in this format. **There are people who travel from around the world to Cinemark 17 to catch films in IMAX 70MM**.

I'm not passing any judgement, but I've been seeing a lot of questions about the film in this sub, especially since the re-release. Now, the film definitely is worth a couple of viewings to get the finer points, but I was genuinely baffled by some of the questions people ask. I don't consider myself exceptionally intelligent, just average. I'm not claiming to be smarter than the people asking questions, but the answers often seem obvious to me. 

It got me thinking. A huge film from one of the biggest directors in the business, with an all-star cast, and one of the best scores in film history. It was bound to bring in outsiders to the genre. I'm used to discussing sci-fi with fellow sci-fi fans, and I think we all just have a leg-up on the common tropes and concepts of science fiction.

I just watched interstellar for the first time and I loved it but like most people got confused with parts of the movie.

But as I start unraveling the science behind wormholes, time dilation, and the fifth dimension, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîhow did Cooper communicate through the tesseract? Was the ‚Äòthey‚Äô really future humans, or something beyond our understanding? And if time is a physical dimension, does that mean everything has already happened, just waiting to be observed?

So 12 people were sent out to 12 different planets during the Lazarus missions.

Considering it took 2 years to get to Saturn, how could anyone have had time to travel to another start system, even if it was much closer than Proxima Centauri is to us.  

Why about a multi-star system you ask?  As an example of distance in even a 3 star system Proxima is .2 light years from Alpha Centauri.  Saturn is .00017 light years from earth.  That‚Äôs over 1000 times farther which would take 2000 years for humans in their universe to travel.  Not plausible.

1801,interstellar,"I like the movie, but for me the ending totally undermines the main premise

Throughout the movie the focus is on the relationship between Murphy and Cooper. The agony of being left by your parent (after losing the other one too) and the agony of leaving your child for the greater good, and eventually for their own survival.

But when Cooper finally gets back to Murphy, number one the actress bears no resemblance to child Murphy or adult Murphy so you lose the connection on a visceral level, and the reunion is underwhelming and brief. Murphy is also bedridden so you can't have any sort of epic embrace. They then shoehorn in some connection with Cooper and Brand and treat that relationship like its the example of the strength of love from Brand's speech earlier, and not the love between Muphy and Cooper, parent and child.

As a Dad of 2 young girls, for me romantic love pales in comparison to the love a parent has for a child, by a wide margin, and that's the relationship they should have concentrated on.

This film has something at its emotional center: **the relationship between a father with his daughter**. But Cooper and Murph Cooper aren't the only father-daughter pair on this story, there is also Dr. Brand and his daughter, Amelia Brand.

From Dr. Brand point of view, he was sending his daughter to a place where she got a chance to be part of the new colony. Of course, his daughter ends up finding out, but only because Dr. Cooper told Dr Brand's daughter the truth. He didn't want to tell his daughter the world was ending. I'm not saying he was right by the way, but I can think he was wrong and empathize at the same time.

This is a way for Christopher Nolan to explore the father-daughter dynamic from two angles:

\- The father that went far away to save his daughter world while she becomes a scientist working on the research.

\- The hopeless father doing the research who sent his own daughter away to save her from what he saw as a dying world.

on  
Both men are driven by love, but they take a different approach in their hope and despair. 

This is all I got to say for now about:

\- Cooper, the crew member, and his daughter back on earth, Dr Cooper

\- Brand the crew member, and her father back at the earth, Dr. Brand",2025-01-28 19:32:22,242,0,0.9514,1,1,1.0

I‚Äôm sorry if this has already been discussed, but here are my two ‚Äúthey‚Äù theories I came up with on my last watch. 

Theory 1: humans did not survive but AI kept evolving. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù are human created AI that has survived and became advanced enough to learn the secrets of gravity and sent back the worm whole so that humans can also survive the death of earth. 

Theory 2: ‚ÄúThey‚Äù are the future humans evolved from plan B (which was in reality plan A). Since love is quantifiable and transcends time and space (a theme in the movie), these future humans sent the anomalies and wormhole back for the humans on earth, who didn‚Äôt make it out alive, to figure out how to also live.

I know a lot of folks have been sharing their stories seeing this film recently, and I just wanted to throw my story on top of the pile:

This is probably my favorite film, it's certainly the only one I've gone out of my way to see so many times now.  I saw it for the first time when it originally released and when I heard there was a 10th anniversary IMAX release I felt I had to see it.  I don't get to go to the movies much, due to children and honestly feeling like it's more worth it to just wait for movies to be available to watch from the convenience of home.  The last movie I'd seen in theaters was the Paw Patrol Might Pups Movie lol.  But my wife could tell how much it meant to me and we arranged for a time for me to see it at a theater nearby last month.  It was a great experience, but the one thing that was surprising to me as soon as I walked in the theater was I thought ""huh, I thought IMAX was bigger than this?  This looks about the same as I remember regular theaters being.""  I went home that afternoon and looked up the different types of IMAX and realized this was not the IMAX experience I thought I was signing up for.  Still, I was so glad I'd seen it because who knows when the next time I'd be able to see it in theaters would be. 

Flashforward to this month, we're visiting some family in Central Florida from our home in the Midwest.  We took a weekend trip from her family's house in Central FL down to Ft Lauderdale to visit some other friends down there.  We decide to go to the science museum in Ft Lauderdale, and while there I find out they're showing Interstellar for a limited time only in IMAX 70 MM.  BY this point, I'd thought all the IMAX showings were done and I really didn't think I'd have a chance to see it in 70 MM.  We went back to our hotel that night, got the kids down to sleep, and my wife told me I should go see it.  She had to convince me, but I went.  I got down there, went to buy a ticket and the guy at the desk told me they were sold out (obviously!).  He offers me to come back another day, and I told him this is my only night in the area.  I walk out dejected, stand there for a minute to text my wife, and then he comes out and says he thinks he has a few extra tickets and can get me in.  I was so excited I handed him my credit card and didn't even think about how sketchy it was that I didn't get a receipt or ticket or confirmation at all.  I'm continuing to monitor my credit card activity, but the experience was incredible.  I didn't have the best seat but it was amazing and I'm so glad I went.  

Last thought which ties it all together: The first time I saw this I was single, and now as I mentioned I have kids, and the film totally hits different.  ""Now, we're just here to be memories for our kids""

The doc says, "".. you were extremely lucky. We found you when there were only minutes of oxygen left..""

What I wonder: 
I know that Cooper was inside tesseract, realm beyond the 4 dimensions we know. Back when Cooper was in the tesseract he was of course breathing. He was outside time, so we don't know how long(?!) he was there, or if that even applies. 
He was there for an 'x' amount of the 5th dimension (whatever it is). Does the oxygen time count here, how does that work. ü§Ø

Just watched the movie and most of my open questions were answered by reading forums.. however there are two things I still dont fully understand...

a) why do they needed to solve the equation to save humanity? I saw some users saying it was necessary to transport those big spacecrafts through the wormhole to reach the new planet.. But they clearly already had the technology to go there since Cooper and his group already flew over there? And even if that technology wasn't enough to build these big spacecrafts then why not only sending like 1.000 people in smaller aircrafts over like team Cooper? Wasnt plan A always a possibility just for fewer people instead of all humankind? Why did the professor Brand even consider plan B then?

b) how did Murph and the other humans on earth find out about Brand being alive and that the planet is useable as new home for humans? If she brought a working transmitter and could relate the data due to the time difference didnt they only find out moments before Cooper woke up in the hospital?

I find it interesting how the Plan B colonists will start human civilization from a bunch of frozen embryos. Surely the Edmund people will eventually meet up with space humans, but we don't know how long they would be on their own. 

Some things I ponder about: 

1. How long do you think Amelia waited until Cooper and the ""Plan A"" people? Or would she be dead before the other humans arrive? 
2. How do you think the first 10 people will be raised? Most likely robots will be teachers. But eill they be taught equally or specialised on each field? 
4. How will these 10 people raise the next batch? 
5. How much human knowledge are they able to bring there? Do you think they have music, movies, art, etc.? 
6. How do you think the interaction will go when the Edmund-born colonists meet up with their space-born brethren? 
7. How do you imagine Amelia and Cooper as parents to these kids? 
8. By the time Amelia and Cooper reach their max lifespan, how much population would have grown?

1926,interstellar,"[SPOILERS] The importance of Romilly's character.

As a writer, I thought Romilly was a very well-used character.  Here's what I got from him:

1. Romilly provides shock value when Cooper and Brand return to the ship, to demonstrate the passage of 23 years.  Obvious enough.

2. Of course Romilly dies.  People have to die occasionally, to remind the audience of the danger to our heroes.

3. Romilly spent some of his alone-time on the ship, studying the black hole.  They don't delve deep into this, just skim past it (mentioned twice - once before and once after ice planet), but it's entirely possible his research could have added/seeded the beginnings of future work that would, in fact, help future humansbuild a wormhole and place it near Saturn for us to find.  Or to help us build a tesseract.  He could have laid the foundations for himself to travel through the wormhole.

4. Romilly triggers the booby trap.  This lets the audience see just how fucked up Dr. Mann was.  While Dr. Mann said words like, ""*I'm going to complete this mission... for you.  I'll do it for you.*""  In fact, he long-planned the death of others to save his own ass.  Without that explosion, it's possible some audience members may have sympathized with Mann.  The preplanned detonation of a bomb eliminates any sympathy.

5. Here's where Romilly's value really shines - he waits on a ship for 23 years 4 months and 11 hours.  Dr. Mann was alone on a planet for a few years (7?  10?).  He couldn't stand the solitude nor his own inevitable death.  Dr. Mann says, to Cooper, something like, ""*I hope you never know the pain of just needing to see another human for so long,*"" referring to his own 10 years alone.  But Romilly did exactly that for 23 years 4 months and 11 hours.  Romilly demonstrates just how strong a human soul can be, while juxtaposing just how weak Dr. Mann really was.",2014-11-21 16:18:51,3510,0,-0.6963,-1,-1,0.9835277777777776

1930,interstellar,"One of Nolan‚Äôs ironic twists‚Ä¶

Felt compelled to do another 10th Anniversary appreciation post‚Ä¶

(TOP) Early in the film Professor Brand tells Cooper: ‚ÄúSomething sent you here. They chose you.‚Äù Here we‚Äôre led to believe that those responsible for the wormhole and gravitational anomalies ‚Äúchose‚Äù Cooper to save the remaining people on earth.

(MIDDLE) Cooper tells Murph: ‚ÄúThey chose me. Murph, they chose me. You‚Äôre the one who led me to ‚Äòem.‚Äù Here Cooper emphasizes to Murph (and to the audience) that he has been chosen by the ‚ÄúThey‚Äù behind the gravitational anomalies at their farm (the NASA dust coordinates in binary, the fallen books, the corrupted navigation system in the Indian Surveillance Drone, and compass interference in the harvester and automated farm machines). 

(BOTTOM) After realizing that he and TARS brought themselves to this moment, to be the bridge (and messengers) between the fifth-dimension and our third-dimensional world, Cooper then communicates via backward-in-time gravitational forces by manipulating the world tube dust lines, sending his younger self and Murph the coordinates to NASA in binary. It‚Äôs here where it dawns on Cooper and the audience that it was his future self who led his younger self to NASA (a ‚Äúcausal loop‚Äù that has always existed). Ironically, Cooper also realizes that the bulk beings didn‚Äôt choose him after all. Cooper, while looking into the room with falling dust, delightedly says to TARS, ‚ÄúI thought they chose me. But they didn‚Äôt choose me. They chose her‚Ä¶.to save the world!‚Äù

This is another instance of Nolan brilliantly employing ‚Äúsituational irony‚Äù into the narrative. For the majority of the film we are led to believe that Cooper was chosen by the bulk beings of the future to save the world. (Both Professor Brand and younger Cooper reinforce this). But in a surprising ironic twist, after Cooper enters the Tesseract he realizes the bulk beings actually chose Murph to save the world - not him. Further, he discovers what his and TARS‚Äôs role is - to be the bridge between dimensions and to communicate - to send a message (the quantum data) to Murph by exerting gravitational forces across spacetime so she can solve the problem of gravity and save the remaining people on Earth.

1982,interstellar,"Nolan‚Äôs use of foreshadowing and irony‚Ä¶

(TOP) At the start of the film, after Cooper awakes from a nightmare, he turns to his ten-year-old daughter Murph standing in the doorway‚Ä¶and she says: ‚ÄúI thought you were the ghost.‚Äù To which Cooper replies: ‚ÄúNo, there are no such things as ghosts.‚Äù

(MIDDLE) Murph, after looking at her childhood notebook page where she had deciphered and wrote ‚ÄúSTAY,‚Äù realizes that her Dad was her ghost, that it was actually him communicating with her across spacetime using gravitational signals/forces traveling backward in time. And we the audience are struck by the ‚Äúsituational irony‚Äù Nolan creates given what Cooper says to Murph early in the film:  ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think your bookshelf‚Äôs trying to talk to you.‚Äù

(BOTTOM) In yet another emotional moment, Cooper tells elderly Murph that he was her ghost, to which she replies: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù He then asks how she knew. Murph points to the watch she‚Äôs still wearing‚Ä¶.which makes us think of two scenes: the MIDDLE (above) and when she notices the twitching of the watch‚Äôs second hand - moments where Murph realizes that it was her father all along (her ghost) that was sending her messages across spacetime. 

All of this points to how masterful Nolan is as a screenwriter. His usage of narrative/literary devices like ‚Äúforeshadowing‚Äù and ‚Äúsituational irony‚Äù furthers the emotion (and our emotional investment) in the film and the bond that Murph and Cooper share.

who had never seen Interstellar before. She was maybe late teens and came with her dad. It wasn‚Äôt until Millers planet when I discerned it was her first time.

I‚Äôve been working through a list of highly acclaimed movies, and I saved Interstellar for just the right moment. And let me tell you my entire life has been CHANGED after watching this. 

This film is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word! The performances from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway were nothing short of stunning, and talking about the visuals. The black hole? The waves on Miller‚Äôs planet? The tesseract scene?? I was literally on the edge of my seat, jaw on the floor, questioning my entire understanding of time and space. And one of the best parts was the Hans Zimmer‚Äôs score. It was haunting beautiful, almost like a spiritual experience. üòÇ

The story was so emotional and thought provoking, tackling love, time, and humanity‚Äôs survival in such a unique way. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs definitely one of the best films I‚Äôve ever seen. The ending was the first time I‚Äôve had tears watching a film in years. 

I‚Äôm now looking recommendations for films that can evoke a similar sense of wonder and introspection. What should I watch next to continue my cinematic journey? Thanks! :)

[The earth has two tidal bulges caused by the Moon.](http://www.aztecsailing.co.uk/theory/Ch2-Fig-1-tidal-bulge.gif) The sea level is naturally several feet higher at the two opposite points on Earth's surface that are closest to, and furthest from, the Moon. A person on Earth experiences this as two high tides every day: as the Earth spins, a point on Earth passes ""through"" the tidal bulges.

This explains the giant wave planet. The planet is closely orbiting a black hole, Gargantua. Its gravity has collected the planet's entire ocean into two **mind-meltingly massive** bulges on opposite sides of the planet. As the planet spins on its axis (about once per hour) any point on the planet experiences two ""high tides"" every hour. 

That's not all. Why is the planet perfectly flat? Because the force of the megatide has scoured away all the continents, polishing the planet's surface to a perfect sphere. Since the water has nowhere to collect (like the oceans on Earth) it spreads out in a uniform 1-foot layer across the planet. Except, of course... when it's High Tide.

I love Interstellar but I always thought it was kind of a weird choice by the filmmakers to have Murphy tell Cooper to go at the end instead of having a longer scene of them being back together. It wasn't until recently that I realized it's a direct parallel to how Murphy told Cooper to stay at the beginning. It's representing how we change as we get older - Murphy still loves her dad, but she doesn't need him in the same way she did as a kid anymore. 

And this scene happens while the soundtrack repeats the melodic motif from Stay!

Now you have ruined any movie that I may ever watch. I can't settle for regular movies now. You have ruined it.

After much time waiting, I finally convinced my parents to, for my birthday, travel all the way from Italy to London so that we could see Interstellar in IMAX 70mm!
It was amazing, I was sat at the fourth row in the center right in the Ronson theater, and it almost covered my whole peripheral view! It was also nice watching it in a movie theater and, for example, hearing people laughing at the jokes (especially between Tars and Cooper).
The audio and quality was top notch, especially the IMAX sequences where really able to immerse me into the movie! 
I‚Äôve actually understood even more little details of the movie, even though I‚Äôve already watched it perhaps 10 or more times!
I definitely recommend it to anyone who can to go watch it, as it is truly a once in a lifetime experience!",2024-10-03 18:59:25,1064,0,0.9745,1,1,1.0
2103,interstellar,"Today is a very important day for Interstellar's comunity

After watch the movie for the 540th, I thought of something that some of you may have already thought of:

Considering that the film was released on November 5, 2014... And in Miller's planet 1 hour equal 7 years in Earth time... If I were on Miller's planet on the day the film premiered, where in the film would I be today in Earth time, after all these years?

So here are my calculations, I hope I did them correctly

- Calculate the time difference on Earth from the landing/premiere date to the current date:

Landing/premiere date: November 5, 2014.
Current date: June 28, 2024.
Elapsed time: From November 5, 2014, to November 5, 2023, there are 9 complete years. From November 5, 2023, to June 28, 2024, there are 7 months and 23 days.

- Convert the time difference on Earth to hours:

9 years = 9 * 365.25 days (considering leap years) = 3287.25 days.
7 months (November to June):
November: 25 days (from November 5 to November 30)
December: 31 days
January: 31 days
February: 28 days
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 28 days (from June 1 to June 28)
Total days in 7 months = 25 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 = 235 days.
Total days = 3287.25 + 235 = 3522.25 days.

Convert days to hours: 3522.25 days * 24 hours/day = 84,534 hours.

- Calculate how much time this represents on planet Miller:

Time ratio: 1 hour on Miller is equivalent to 7 years on Earth.
7 years on Earth = 7 * 365.25 days = 2556.75 days.
1 day on Earth = 24 hours.
2556.75 days = 2556.75 * 24 hours = 61,362 hours on Earth equivalent to 1 hour on Miller.
1 hour on Miller is equal to 61,362 hours on Earth.
84,534 hours on Earth / 61,362 hours per hour on Miller = 1.378 hours on Miller.

- Calculate the fraction of the movie watched:

Movie duration: 2 hours and 49 minutes.
2 hours and 49 minutes = 2 + 49/60 = 2.8167 hours.

The position in the movie:

1.378 hours spent on planet Miller in relation to Earth.
1.378 hours / 2.8167 hours (total movie duration) = 0.489, which corresponds to approximately 48.9% of the movie watched.

- Calculate the specific part of the movie watched:

Total movie duration in minutes: 2 hours and 49 minutes = 169 minutes.
48.9% of 169 minutes = 82.7 minutes.
Therefore, the crew would be watching approximately the 83rd minute of the 169-minute long movie. This corresponds to 1 hour and 23 minutes into the movie.

and I‚Äôve been contemplating the impact of the film for the past 6 hours, the past year, and the past decade on my life. Truly a life changing experience that I wish anyone - wherever you are, wherever you‚Äôve been, wherever you are going to and through, when you find yourself at any point in your own timeline - don‚Äôt go gentle. Go, explore, and discover the experiences that cross space and time in the universe. Find what love means to you. Find what makes you want to stay. Find what makes you decide what‚Äôs necessary even if it‚Äôs impossible. Fear not death. Fear not betrayal, lies, mistakes, nor glory. Fear not even time, because by doing so, you will have evolved past that dimension. Go and find worlds unknown, go and save the world, go and enjoy hotdogs (or popcorn) at baseball games, just. don‚Äôt. go. gentle.

go buy a ticket to see this in IMAX. go rent the movie. go recommend it to your loved ones. go talk about it with strangers on the internet. just. don‚Äôt. go. gentle.

 i was gone. nobody knows how long. for me it could have been a decade. for others, a fraction of it. but I came back. I came back after leaving the theaters in 2014 to return on a mission and I promised myself to watch this on its 10 year anniversary. Yet I never knew that I would find the version of who I am today. A version of me with unexpected experiences, challenges, heartbreak, and loss. Older, wiser, yet still on this quest for connection - looking back, forward, and in all directions - spinning controllably toward the unknown. This version of me is letting go of time well spent and well wasted. The only way to get somewhere is to leave something behind and I am finally leaving behind this promise, because it happened.

Whatever can happen, will happen. And that sounds fine to me. ",2024-12-07 03:39:11,1019,0,0.9605,1,1,1.0

I like how Nolan makes Murph‚Äôs bedroom built-in bookcase a character in Interstellar (In this photo we see Murph in front of her bookcase when she‚Äôs 10, 40, and elderly).

I've been seeing a lot of speculation on the nature of the ""fifth dimension"" in Interstellar, as well as the paradox of Cooper creating the events that begin the story. I wanted to chip in my two cents, while also giving some historical and scientific perspective to the ideas.

**What is the fifth dimension?**

One thing I'm hearing a lot is this idea of the fifth dimension representing all the possible alternate realities, and ways things could have played out. There's no reason for us to suspect this, and I don't recall it ever being described as such in the movie. The important thing, from my understanding, is that the fifth dimension is nothing more than an extra geometrical dimension added to spacetime.

In relativity, we learn that spacetime is a four-dimensional surface which we live in. We're highly limited in our perception of it. As three-dimensional beings, we can only perceive in two dimensions (though we may create the illusion of depth through the positioning of our eyes). However, we're rapidly moving along a path called our [world line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line) through spacetime. As we move, the images we see are the projection of our past [light cone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone), which is a three-dimensional surface that consists of all points in the past which are ""shooting"" their light rays into the future towards us. We are restricted in our motion to always be within our *future* light cone, which means we can't travel backwards in time, only forwards.

Four dimensional beings could, in theory, travel anywhere they want in the spacetime. They would be capable of perceiving fully in *three* dimensions; they could see an entire spatial ""slice"" of spacetime at once. If you held up a cube, they would see all 6 sides at once, while we can see only three. This would restrict them from perceiving all of time.

Certain theories suppose that our universe has more than four dimensions. One of the first theories to propose this was [Kaluza-Klein theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory) which supposed that there is a 5th dimension that is circular, meaning it's wrapped up. If you kept travelling along this fifth dimension you'd end up back where you started. The theory showed that general relativity with five dimensions is the same as general relativity in four dimensions plus electromagnetic theory. Here, the fifth dimension has nothing to do with possible universes or Many-Worlds Theory, but is just an extra geometric dimension, wrapped up so tightly we can't see it. [String theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) later adopted this idea.

Another use of the fifth dimension in physics is found in general relativity as the [de Sitter space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space). This postulates that spacetime has many higher dimensions, that may be large and not wrapped up, and the spacetime we live in is just a ""slice"" of this higher spacetime.

What would a five-dimensional being be? It could move around in all of those five dimensions, and be able to perceive four at once. In that way, it could see our entire universe and its history, in one glance. However, it'd be hard to focus on individual points in time. It'd be like if I asked you to focus only on a single vertical line in your vision. We don't really perceive geometrical objects as much as we perceive patterns, and it'd be the same for 5D beings, perceiving patterns in our history.

What would five-dimensional architecture look like? Let's try to imagine the 5D analog of a cube. To do this, start in 4D. The 4D analog of a cube is a [tesseract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract). To imagine it, we can only consider what projections of the tesseract onto 3D space are like - which is hard, because as I said before, we can only see in two dimensions. We can't even see the entirety of a cube. What we see when we look at a cube is the sides, projected onto our plane of vision. A cube has squares for sides, and so a tesseract would have cubes for sides. But when it is projected onto 3D space, the cubes get distorted, and they change shape as the tesseract moves through its 3D space, just like you don't see the sides of a cube as true squares, but as diamonds that stretch and move as you rotate the cube.

A [5D cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cube) would have tesseracts for sides. It's nearly impossible to imagine what this would look like projected onto 3D space, but it'd be like trying to draw a tesseract on paper - going from 4D to 2D. However, we get a glimpse of the full 3D image of a 5-cube in Cooper's black hole scene. We see Murph's room, a cube, stacked on top of, diagonal to, and beside itself in all sorts of weird ways. Here we can imagine an enormous 5D shape, each side of which is an enormous 4D shape, each side of which is a cube. All of these ""sides"" were projected into Cooper's 3D space for his exploration.

In *Interstellar*, we can imagine that humanity eventually gained the ability to travel through this fifth dimension, and perhaps eventually build bodies for themselves in it, allowing them to perceive the entire universe.

...so what then?

**The time paradox**

If there's no other possible universes, how did Cooper change the past? In sci-fi it's often called a [Stable Time Loop](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop). It's hard to say what it's called in physics because many theoretical physicists try to distance themselves from time travel, FTL, and other things as much as possible. The idea is that the future can influence the past, just as the past influences the future. This can be done through time travel, or something even worse... [boundary conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem). (anyone who solves differential equations often automatically hears a *bum bum bummm* at those words)

I'm not going to talk about time travel, because there was no time travel in this movie. Nada. Zilch. There was only influencing the past through gravitational waves, and this fits more in the dreaded second category.

What is a [gravitational wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave)? It's a disturbance in spacetime, but it's weird to think about because we perceive waves as moving. If we want to start thinking like 5D beings we have to stop thinking of the universe as a dynamic thing that's changing, but a single tapestry that can be viewed all at once. In this perspective, waves are neither generated nor received: they only exist, connecting the past to the future. For us to find out what the strength of the wave is at different points, we have to solve some kind of [harmonic equation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LaplacesEquation.html), but these equations typically have an infinite number of solutions. To pick the ""correct"" one in a given scenario, we need to know the strength and slope of the wave at some particular region of spacetime. This is called a boundary condition.

To put this in more everyday language: if I told you everything about the weather, down to where every atom in the atmosphere is located and what direction it's moving in, you could tell me the weather tomorrow. This is determinism (unfortunately, it's undercut by the fact that we don't have all the info, so we have to factor in chaos and such). But what if I told you all of that information, for *two days from now*? Since the laws of physics run the same both ways, you could just run your calculations backwards a day and still have an answer for tomorrow's weather. So, is the weather tomorrow determined by the weather today, or is today's weather determined by tomorrow's? Our experiences as 3D beings have restricted us to experiencing one day at a time. Because today comes before tomorrow, we see today's events as influencing tomorrow's. A 5D being, however, would say that *one cannot exist without the other*. 

Even with quantum effects of randomness, quantum field theories use principles that strongly link the future and the past together. Also, on a macroscopic scale - and *Interstellar* deals with about as macroscopic scales as you can get - most quantum randomness gets cancelled out, leaving us with a rather well-behaved universe.

Back to stable time loops, then. We can say that Cooper was called into space, and then created the circumstances of his own calling. Or we can say that he created the circumstances of his own calling, and then followed that calling in the past. In 5D language, we would say that Cooper's past and future were interacting in a remarkable tangible way that defies our 3D understanding. However, just because it's weird doesn't mean it's wrong. A consistent theme in the movie is that of exploration, and more than most other films with that theme, *Interstellar* shows us that discovering new worlds requires altering our perspective, even when it's contrary to our everyday perception.

---

I hope this was interesting to people! A lot of these ideas are rightfully beyond our intuition, and even the physicists who work with them daily will struggle with them often. There's still much debate over how to interpret the philosophical and temporal implications of these theories. I've done my best to explain the parts which I've grappled with, and I hope I laid it out in a coherent manner.

Good afternoon TARS fans,

Been tinkering with this custom Interstellar Watch for a few months. Finally getting to where I want to be. 

I designed the dial in Lightburn, cut it out of a 0.5mm sheet of brass, hand painted and polished it. Fitted it to a Seiko automatic NH38 movement and paired it with a 39mm dress watch case and gold hands. Decorated the movement and engraved the Caseback as well. 

The dial features the Endurance, Morse Code (STAY), Binary Code (coordinates to NASA), and my favorite quote from Coop.

I have a very good (not incredible) 65 inch Samsung TV from 2020. I've watched this movie plenty of times in this TV and was satisfied. I watched it on digital IMAX earlier this month and mounted the TV to my wall tonight (previously sat on my entertainment center). 

I received the 10th anniversary set for my birthday (right before Christmas) and finally got to use it. First, I found out that I didn't have anything to play 4k Blu Ray (XBone). Second, the movie had been playing for 3 minutes when I turned to my wife and said ""I need a 95"" TV."" She laughed and told me I was silly. 25 minutes in she told me that the 65 inch TV would look great in our bedroom and asked me if I thought that 95 inches was enough and if we should get a 4k laser protector at 150 inches because ""how are you supposed to fully enjoy this movie when it's so small?"" 

Now I need something to play 4k Blu-ray and a very large TV or incredible projector. This movie ruins home theater systems. ",2024-12-29 10:35:52,548,0,0.9589,1,1,1.0

Another recurring narrative element that Nolan includes at the end of many of his films is ‚Äúreuniting with family, loved ones, and friends.‚ÄùEnding on a cathartic note, full of reconciliation, is so effective, emotionally moving the audience. At the end of **Interstellar**, Cooper reunites with his daughter Murph (‚ÄúBecause my Dad promised me‚Äù). That was such a heartfelt and powerful scene. Then Murph tells Cooper to take off to help and reunite with Amelia. In the final moments of **Inception** Cobb reunites with his children Phillipa and James. Such a powerful scene with Cobb finally being able to see their faces again. **The Dark Knight Rises** concludes with Batman (Bruce) reuniting with Catwoman (Selina) at the cafe, another powerful moment. At the end of **Dunkirk** ‚Äúhome‚Äù rescues all the surviving troops, allowing them to reunite with their families. **Insomnia** ends with Dormer reconciling with Ellie, telling her not to lose her way. In the final scene of **The Prestige‚Äù Borden is reunited with his daughter. **Tenet** ends with The Protagonist going back to London to look after Kat from afar, protecting her and Max from what might have been.

The last 30ish minutes had me crying my eyes out but also had me feeling a transcendent sense of hope. A hope I haven't felt in a long time. Such a excellent film. Especially the ending. The way he has weaved together the extremely personal and the existential. Absolutely sublime. But fuck you for making me cry this much :-)",2024-05-27 08:13:38,519,0,0.911,1,1,1.0
2363,interstellar,"Christopher Nolan explains why he broke his own rules for a critical scene in Interstellar

Nolan recounts filming one of Interstellar‚Äôs most emotional scenes, wherein McConaughey watches videos of his children that he‚Äôs missed over the years. Nolan did two things that he wouldn‚Äôt normally do, but he says they ultimately made sense for that specific moment.

‚ÄúThe wonderful truth is that it was in my brother‚Äôs script, and one of the things that made me want to do the film. As a parent, it seemed like such a powerful story moment. It was always the north star of the film, this beautiful sequence‚Äîand some of the actual words in the script, the specifics of what was said in the messages, never changed. We filmed McConaughey‚Äôs reaction first, in close-up. You never do that in a scene. You start with a wide shot and then warm up. But he hadn‚Äôt seen the video messages‚Äîwe‚Äôd filmed them all in advance, so that everything would be there in the moment‚Äîand he wanted to give us his first reaction. We shot it twice close-up, and I think I used the second one, because the first one was too raw. Then we shot the monitors, and the wider shots, and put it together.

The last piece of the puzzle was a beautiful piece of music by Hans Zimmer that hadn‚Äôt really found a place in the film. I think he literally referred to it as ‚Äúorgan doodle.‚Äù My editor, Lee Smith, and I tried playing it just while we were in the room playing a cut, and we both felt that it was devastating. The other thing we did, which I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done in any of my other films, is to treat the music as a diegetic sound: When the messages stop, the music stops. It almost breaks the fourth wall, and it‚Äôs not the sort of thing that I like to do, but it felt perfect and apt for that moment.‚Äù

CHANGELOG:

Version - 5.0

* Re-balanced volume across the board
* Added simulated vocals, like from ‚ÄúTick-Tock‚Äù Suite
* Enhanced all organ stem high end, chimier and more like the original

* Detailed track removing any clipping or random timing issues

----

Version - 4.4

* Re-balanced all volumes again, mostly for the middle and the end 
* added a new transition at 2:00 so that it didn't feel like it just dropped into an empty part of the track or something.

FLAC: https://mega.co.nz/#!bMpxGYAJ!idGlbvwSaF-wVwmCT9j6Y-ReHkd5u6xYat6hNZs5g5E

* Boosted low end significantly (you should be able to easily tell)
* Lots of fixes after hunting down volume anomalies
* Made the first half of ""No Time For Caution"" much more audible in the beginning, uses less of ""Day One Dark"", but can easily still hear the best parts from both.
* Now using 98% LOSSLESS sources, thanks to those who provided them to me! (This means a lot of my editing work was re-worked from scratch to replace the lossy sources)
* Sounds fatter/bigger/louder like the rest of the OST.
* Ending has been tweaked to sound as close to perfect as possible.
* All transitions are now accurate
* Added piano transition from film version that goes before organ crescendo. 
* All arpeggios are now way closer in the mix instead of being in the background and hard to hear.
* Proper dynamics have been realized for the guitar/organ starting at 2:00. 
* String stem is easier to hear

**Note: Still no source for earlier vocals**

-----
Version 3 - 3.5:

MP3: https://mega.co.nz/#!fYgmQCiS!mZaQ_UR175BB34fpu66YlguZJ_RGj10mrbXZHUNo4PY


* Added Organ stems
* **Added Grand Piano (Extrabass) stems (fixed in 3.5)**
* Tweaked Dynamics
* Reworked the whole track (volume, re-enforced more parts toward the beginning, so the beginning will sound a lot fatter, etc.)
* Just made everything much bigger and better in general, the way it would have sounded on the OST in the first place.


Notes about Version 3:

I just had a few repeat viewings in IMAX to confirm a few things:

1. The Vocals are not nearly as loud in the mix as previously thought, it is nothing like they were in ""Mountains"". They start earlier in the film version but I don't have a good enough source for me to use the vocals earlier, so it will stay as is.

2. Organ isn't as loud as previously thought either and I have based my arrangement on this. There are still strings and other stems to acknowledge in the mix.


Version Two:


MP3: https://mega.co.nz/#!TJZRTZ4b!48UypvlB8ACBhIyc2I8ijz6LcF2iUuYrPhGsBAUkUxY

Added **Vocals**

------

Version One:


MP3: https://mega.co.nz/#!HBBjiSoQ!utEV5ibfusibrf3JnPZVizE4-O7lKGrThj_ZUKaBLnI

* Louder/far less muddy/Remastered Dynamics
* Merged with source material from Day One - Dark (can hear both recordings in the mix) so the first half sounds a lot less horrible because of the obvious samples
* Merged with ending from ""Wormhole"" track for better dynamics
* Second half of the track sounds less empty
* Re-enforced organ/guitar Arpeggio in the middle of the track
* added experimental organ/string part to carry the ending

------

This is an ongoing project and I need immediate feedback because I am still working on it, and I will go as far as humanly possible to make this shit listenable, posting many revisions until people are satisfied with it.
(Organ stems at the end will be implemented next if you guys are okay with where progress is now)",2014-11-23 00:23:26,484,0,0.9923,1,1,1.0

I turned 18 in September, and I've loved interstellar for as long as I can remember, it's probably my fav movie. I also love space, space movies, the concept of time and how it can warp and overlap in sci-fi, the music in the movie is AMAZING and it's overall a very visually stunning and emotional movie. I want to get this picture tattooed, but I don't know if it's a good idea yet, considering how young I am. I think it's a good idea now, but will that sentiment hold up in 20 years?

Hello fellow TARS lovers, 

Wanted to say thank you for all the positive comments I got on my Brass version of the keychain ([here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/s/cXVdPMt6wo). 

Tried an anodized aluminum version. Much lighter (and quicker to make), and of course you are able to get that sweet sweet dark black for Gargantua. 

I would love to give this away to a fellow Interstellar lover. I'll find a way to randomly pick a name from anyone that comments on this post their favorite Interstellar quote. I'll draw the name this Sunday (Father's day) and be ready to ship out Monday. 

If your interested in more things a 50w fiber can do (or you like custom watches), I would appreciate a follow on my IG linked in my profile. Been a fun journey with this tool so far. Interstellar watch coming up soon this July. 

If you do like the general look of the keychain it is of course customizable with your favorite quote. Just shoot me a message if you're interested.

Number 6 was retired to honor manager Joe Torre. The retirement ceremony didn‚Äôt happen until August of 2014, well after shooting would have concluded but prior to its release.

I heard great things about this movie, but never saw it for whatever reason. I have AMC A list, so I decided to give it a go in IMAX last month. My fiance was busy so I went alone on Saturday night. I knew nothing about this film other than other people liked it and space was involved. 




It was a full theater, to my initial surprise. But, everyone was on their best behavior. I go to a lot of movies, and full theaters do not always mean that people will be respectful. They were this time. 




The world building in the beginning was extremely well done, and I find the idea of the world collective accepting their world's fate with the dreamers few and far between to be all too relatable. The ghosts in the room didn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I was a bit confused, but that will be cleared up later... The drone scene I felt was a bit too thick on showing how smart Coop was, but I understand why it's there. 




The reveal of NASA being a secret and underground makes so much sense given the public perception of space exploration, and hearing John Brand explain the Lazerus missions gave me chills. It seemed all too real given the climate change we are facing today. Coop leaving Murph is heartbreaking, obviously. 






The cinematography of the journey into space is unbelievable. Combined with the score, which I cannot give enough praise to, it was genuinely touching to experience. I've never seen a film show the vastness of space and the wonder of discovery as perfectly as it is here. Also, every character is relatable and I genuinely care for all members of the crew. Robots included.






Miller's planet was the first time my jaw truly hit the floor. When the 23 year bomb is dropped (and seeing Doyle's body), my heart sank. I legitimately felt gutted. The videos that came after made me cry, especially the birth of his kid and Murph's sole contribution. The moment she came one screen I began crying once more. 





Brand's lie legitimately shocked me. Never expected it, and I felt so bad for her daughter. Her performance throughout was also excellent, and the remorse and pain she felt after the Miller debacle was award-worthy. Her hunch with love also proved even more important as time goes on.





Mann's planet left me with another pit in my stomach the moment he started crying. I can't imagine how lonely he must have felt, and even if I hated him, I understand him for doing what he did. His betrayal also shocked me, especially when he detonated his bot on Romily. 






When ""there comes a moment"" happened, that was my second jaw drop. The explosion to silence, the imagery, everything was executed to perfection. Wow. And the spinning docking maneuver, I was legitimately on the edge of my seat. 





The sacrifice of Coop shocked me, but that was nothing compared to the tesseract and piecing together what the ghost was. Coop getting the data to Murphy was my third jaw drop and waterworks to accompany it. I loved the way it was done.  I was floored coop survived. 





Finally, the reunion of father and daughter melted my heart. Just crying so much. ""My dad promised me"" good lord that was touching. 




This movie not only made me feel love, hate, curiosity, laughter, and hope, it made me proud to be a human. It reminded me that we have overcome so much already, and there is hope for the future.  If we all dream big and come together, anything is possible. We are meant for so much more. It was the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. The story, the people, the score, the cinematography. I dragged my fiance to see it with me later that week, and she felt very similar to me. Just wanted to put this into the universe. I don't think I could watch it outside of IMAX, given how perfect it was, but I will hold this movie as the bar going forward. Just wanted to put this out there for your entertainment or to convince you to ***see this movie in any format whatsoever if you haven't seen it yet***

Dr. Mann, Matt Damon was not in any of the promotional materials, my memory recalls he wanted to be kept a secret but that could have been Tom Cruise in another movie too. But I just remember watching this and everyone in the theater gasping when it was him who was Dr. Mann. 

Its interesting because you realize you never saw his face before his awakening, when Cooper first gets to NASA and they talk to him about the ""Bravest among us"" they walk up to Dr. Mann's photo but you can't see who is in the photo.

When they arrive on Miller (the water planet), [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Ay_iDRAbc) starts to play. A prominent feature of the track is a constant ticking.

I just timed 60 seconds of the track, and there were 48 'ticks'. So, each 'tick' interval is 1.25 seconds.

""Every hour on Miller is about 7 years on Earth""
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, and (86400 x 365.25 x 7) or roughly 221,000,000 seconds in 7 years, giving us a conversion factor of 221,000,000/3600 ‚âà 61400 seconds which pass on Earth for every second spent on Miller.

Times this by the interval between each 'tick', and you get 77000 Earth-seconds, about 21 hours.

So, *each 'tick' you hear is a whole day passing on Earth.*

EDIT: If you make the assumption that each 'tick' is exactly 86400 Earth-seconds (One day), then an hour spent on Miller correlates to 7.88 years of Earth-time. The extra 0.88 years could be from a rounding error by the crew, or 7 years was a lower bound estimate. *New headcanon*!",2014-11-21 00:38:39,390,0,0.636,1,1,1.0

I‚Äôve had a distinctive web of thoughts clogged up in my mind for the past couple of days and did not know how or where to express it, so bear with me.

I actually did not get a chance to see Interstellar when it was initially released back in 2014, but thankfully, I got a chance to watch it on an IMAX 70mm screen when it was re-released in December. To say it was mind-blowing would be an understatement‚Äîit‚Äôs what I‚Äôd describe as cinematic hypnotism. Beyond the spellbinding visuals and the transcendent score, my takeaway from the film was that Nolan tried to convey a very heartfelt message about how love is able to transcend time and space, which was what most people thought about it as well.

However, I came across the first teaser, which I‚Äôd never seen before, a couple of weeks ago. What caught my attention was not only the fact that McConaughey‚Äôs lengthy monologue in this teaser wasn‚Äôt present in the film but also that the message wasn‚Äôt something I picked up on.

""We‚Äôve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments‚Ä¶ These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements‚Ä¶ But we lost all that. And perhaps we‚Äôve just forgotten‚Ä¶ That we are still pioneers. That we‚Äôve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us‚Ä¶ Because our destiny lies above us.""

Half the footage used in the teaser was old, real-life footage showcasing mankind's greatest accomplishments. Nolan didn't reveal anything about the story in this teaser but instead tried to set up the larger message of Interstellar‚Äîthat mankind left greatness behind.

There's a scene earlier in the movie between Donald and Cooper in which they talk about how humans don't dream or aspire to great things anymore. Nolan told the audience right then and there what this movie was about, but I hadn't really thought about it to that extent, appreciating it only as well-written conversational dialogue between two great actors. This isn't the only scene that tries to convey this message, though. There are a few scenes placed cleverly throughout the first act of the film that present a world that has turned inward, abandoning scientific ambition in favor of mere survival.

""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" This dialogue (amazingly delivered by McConaughey) tells us something very meaningful‚Äîhumanity has stopped looking up. It has stopped striving for the extraordinary, settling instead for the ordinary. Cooper's frustration with this mindset reflects the film's overall critique of mediocrity and complacency.

Not to get too personal, but this message resonated with me deeply. Not only did we lose the wonder and ambition we used to have, but as humans, we also tend to mock the few people left who actually aspire to be great. A great example of this is how people responded to Timoth√©e Chalamet's speech a couple of weeks ago (funnily enough, Interstellar was also the film that launched him into Hollywood), calling him arrogant and disrespectful just because he boldly stated his desire to be one of the greats. Only some of us still remember to look up once in a while and have genuine wonder about what our limits are, while the majority look down and only try to get past the day, having left any sort of wonder and imagination behind.

Coming back to the film, I realized Nolan utilized this message as a metaphor for the entire story. The world, depicted as one that has left the desire for greatness and high achievements behind (shown in the scene where schools are now teaching kids that the moon landing was fake), is plagued by a crop blight and is confronted with the possible extinction of its largest species. Interstellar travel, which is a big idea, then becomes both a literal and symbolic solution. It represents the need to push boundaries once again and to embrace curiosity and wonder instead of just enduring. Perhaps this is why the ship is called the Endurance.

I initially thought this was a bit of a reach, but Nolan is known for symbolic names‚Äîlike Ariadne in Inception, the palindromic structure of Tenet, etc. The real-life Endurance, the ship from the infamous Antarctic expedition, ended up getting trapped in ice but has now become a legendary story of perseverance. From what I can gather, this parallel reinforces the film's message about how endurance is not just about holding on but about pushing forward. The film's argument is that survival isn't enough‚Äîwe need to aspire to something greater.

That is exactly why the film's emotional core, particularly the father-daughter relationship, ties into this theme perfectly. Love, like exploration, is a force that transcends time and space.

So yes, Nolan cleverly used the dystopian setting as a metaphor for what happens when we lose ambition and the desire for greatness, and space exploration becomes the ultimate expression of reclaiming it. Interstellar is not just a love letter to space exploration, but a call to rekindle human ambition, and that is something I love and respect. Perhaps this applies to Nolan himself, as venturing into ancient Greek mythology for his forthcoming film, The Odyssey, marks a significant departure from his previous work. Having finally been rewarded for his work on Oppenheimer has seemingly fueled him to aspire to a greater form of storytelling.

I'm sure people have talked about this multiple times before, but these are just some of my thoughts that I had to write down. So thanks if you managed to make it to the end despite the length. I just think it's amazing how there is still so much to analyze in Nolan's films years‚Äîhell, decades‚Äîafter they've been released. Will always line up to watch this man's films on day one.

One thing that never quite made sense to me at the end of the film is that Cooper (at his dying daughter's suggestion) essentially steals a ship to go find Brand on Edmunds' planet - presumably in hopes to see if the planet is habitable and/or start a new colony with the frozen embryos.

But if there is any chance that Brand (or Edmunds) is alive, why wouldn't the new colony launch an entire expedition to see if Brand survived and what the planet is like? Or at worst, send a few probes to see what the planet is like?

Is the assumption that Cooper could go back to the Saturn colony depending on what he finds?

# Hey everyone!

With *Interstellar*‚Äôs 10th-anniversary re-release in theaters, I‚Äôve seen a surge of excitement from the community. It‚Äôs incredible to see so many people revisiting this masterpiece on the big screen as it was meant to be experienced. However, I‚Äôve also noticed an increase in posts showing photos and videos taken during theatrical screenings.

Effective immediately, **I am banning all posts containing images or videos taken inside the theater during a screening**.

# Why this rule?

**Respect for the cinematic experience!** *Interstellar* was designed for the big screen, and part of its magic is in the immersion. Taking photos or videos during a screening disrupts that experience for others.

# Why am I adding this rule now?

During the first re-release, I didn‚Äôt enforce this rule because it was just temporary event, lasting only a week. However, with *Interstellar*‚Äôs extended theatrical run and its return in multiple countries, it‚Äôs clear that re-releases are becoming more frequent. Given this trend, I expect more showings in the future, and I want to establish a clear standard now. By setting this rule, I‚Äôm ensuring that our community continues to respect the theatrical experience and the integrity of the film for all future screenings.

### If you see posts violating this rule, please report them.

Forgotten by us! 

It disturbs me Everytime when I watch Interstellar. Tom's character is not much talked about. Though he doesn't have much screen space/ talked about.

I'm not saying that there should have been more screen space for Tom. That would be stupid üòä. it's a beautiful hidden character, that I love. 

 I have two kids and when I think about Tom, it is disturbing. 

I know Tom was a big boy when Cooper left earth. Cooper was closer to Murph as shown in the film. 

But he was an amazing kid in my pov. He loves his dad, grandpa, his farm, their house, and he loves his dad even though they have every right to think that Cooper  lied and abandoned them.

Cooper and Donald they assumed that Tom would be fine. Dude just kept a straight face, hugged and asked for the truck. Man kept the truck, kept his word and farmed. He talks about Nelson's farm just like his old man. 

Tom being a teen would have affected Tom in a different way than Murph. But it wouldn't have been easy for him either.

He was the one happily in touch with Coop, hoped that he would return someday.

Even in the video messages, he just says bye because he wants a kind closure about his dad. 
""She says that I should let you go. I think I am letting you go. I don't know where you are dad. But I hope you are at peace"". 

Even Murph kinda lost touch with him. Tom lived in that house with just memories. Lost his first kid. Lost his grandpa. His second kid's health is failing too.
Turned inwards and we see that he is broken.

Even when he meets Murph in that burning field chaos, he faintly believes that his dad would return. Murph says"" Dad didn't even try.""

He probably died young. 

It's beautiful movie, I'm not saying that there should have been more screen space for Tom. That would be stupid üòä. it's a beautiful hidden character, that I love. 

But just sharing that Tom breaks me everytime in that  23 year old messages scene - than Cooper does.

2668,interstellar,"FAQ: Miller's World (spoilers)

On several forums I've seen moviegoers poking & prodding at ""plot holes"" and ""science errors"" in *Interstellar*. While some are legitimate criticisms, the vast majority have fairly simple explanations. In this post I hope to correct some misconceptions about Miller's world, which seems to be getting the brunt of the criticism. The following is based on information provided in chapter 17 of Kip Thorne's *The Science of Interstellar*.

**General premise:** Miller's world is a roughly Earth-size planet orbiting the supermassive black hole Gargantua. The planet orbits so close that time passes ~61,000x slower on its surface compared to the outside universe due to gravitational time dilation. The surface is covered in a global ocean, and any given point is inundated by skyscraper-size waves every hour or so (local time). 

**Q1: Why doesn't the planet get sucked into the black hole if it's so close?**

**A:** Contrary to popular belief, it is perfectly possible to safely orbit a black hole. Only when an object gets extremely close (roughly when distance to the event horizon < diameter of the event horizon) does the extreme curvature of spacetime prevent stable orbits from existing. But Miller's world is extremely close to Gargantua, so what's holding it there? While Gargantua does have extreme gravity, another property of the singularity can help counteract it in some cases ‚Äì its spin. When enough mass spins fast enough, it can actually ‚Äúdrag‚Äù the spacetime around it in a spinning motion. Gargantua is 100 million times heavier than the Sun and spins at ~~99.8% of lightspeed~~ 0.99999999999999x the maximum possible spin, so this effect is significant. It turns out, when you run the math, that there is an orbit just outside the event horizon where gravity and centrifugal effects balance out, and Miller‚Äôs world can reside. The orbit is also stable: any perturbation pushing the planet slightly closer or further away will cause an opposing reaction force, keeping the planet in its orbit. 

**Q2: Wouldn't the planet be torn to shreds from intense tidal forces?**

**A:** This might stem from a misconception of what tidal forces actually are. Right now, as you‚Äôre sitting in front of your computer, your feet are slightly closer to Earth‚Äôs center than your head. That means there‚Äôs actually a difference in gravity between the two, which manifests as a force working to stretch you vertically ‚Äì a tidal force. Of course, Earth‚Äôs gravity is weak enough that you‚Äôll never actually notice. But go near a black hole with much more intense gravity, and the effect can be *very* significant, enough to rip your body apart before you get anywhere near the event horizon. So how does Miller‚Äôs world stay in one piece if it‚Äôs so close? Counter-intuitively, it‚Äôs because Gargantua is so massive: tidal forces around a black hole *decrease* as the black hole gets larger. Remember, a tidal force comes about because gravity has a different strength on two sides of an object. Gargantua‚Äôs event horizon is as wide as Earth‚Äôs orbit around the Sun. Compared to that, the width of Miller‚Äôs world is absolutely puny. When you run the math, you find that the tidal forces experienced by Miller‚Äôs world would be enough to slightly deform the planet into an egg-shape, but not enough to rip it apart; it‚Äôll stay in one piece.

**Q3: Why do clocks tick slower there? And why did the crew age slower?**

**A:** One of the consequences of Special & General Relativity is that time and space are not absolute, independent things. They are intertwined into one 4D entity ‚Äì spacetime ‚Äì and can be stretched and warped. The warping of time is referred to as ‚Äútime dilation,‚Äù and can occur when A) two objects are travelling incredibly fast relative to each other and/or B) an object is in an extreme gravity field. Both of these effects noticeably affect Miller‚Äôs world: it‚Äôs zipping around Gargantua at nearly 50% lightspeed in its orbit, and is very deep in the black hole‚Äôs extreme gravity well. The cumulative effect of these two facts is that *time itself runs slower* on Miller‚Äôs world relative to the rest of the universe: 1 hour on the planet equals 7 years on Earth. Such extreme dilation is possible due to Gargantua‚Äôs immense mass and proportionally immense gravity. Note that this isn‚Äôt just something that affects clocks. It affects any physical process that involves time, including all the molecular interactions in your body that keep you alive and cause you to age. Literally *everything* runs slower on the planet ‚Äì but you wouldn‚Äôt notice, because your thoughts and cognitive processes would have slowed by the same amount. To you, the outside universe would be running fast, and to anyone far away from the black hole, they would see you running in slow motion. 

**Q4: What's making those waves?**

**A:** There are a few theories making the rounds; what follows is Kip Thorne‚Äôs theory, which I personally think explains them best. Recall that although they don‚Äôt rip it apart, tidal forces from Gargantua are enough to distort Miller‚Äôs world into more of an egg-shape than a sphere. Due to its now-slightly-elongated shape, the planet will have a preferred orientation relative to the black hole, with its long axis perpendicular to the event horizon. It will be tidally locked: one side will always face Gargantua, and the other will always face away. Tidal forces act to maintain this stable orientation ‚Äì any slight rotation away from it will cause a reaction force acting to push it back. Here‚Äôs where the waves come in. If Miller‚Äôs world were just barely *not* tidally locked (had a slight residual spin), it would instead oscillate slightly back and forth like a pendulum around its most stable orientation. These periodic oscillations would make the planetary ocean slosh back and forth, and could create massive waves like those seen in the film.

**Q5: How did the Ranger reach the planet at all if it‚Äôs spinning around Gargantua at half of lightspeed?**

**A:** Supermassive black holes tend to gather a lot of smaller bodies (stars, planets, debris, etc.) in their orbital space. Gargantua doesn‚Äôt just have 3 planets, there‚Äôs loads of other stuff orbiting it. Cooper references this at one point when he says ‚ÄúI could slingshot around that neutron star to slow down.‚Äù By using carefully calculated gravitational slingshots around small high-gravity objects like neutron stars and mini-black-holes, the Ranger could have gotten from *Endurance*‚Äôs parking orbit high above Gargantua down to Miller‚Äôs world without using the engines much. Plus, since the Ranger & crew will be in freefall during the slingshots, they won‚Äôt feel any G-forces despite the tremendous accelerations they‚Äôll be undergoing. 

~ ~ ~

All that said, there is *one* outright impossible thing about Miller's world - [this image]( http://i.imgur.com/YOmnC3f.jpg) from when the Ranger descends to the surface. Gargantua is depicted as being about 20x larger in the planet's sky than the Moon is in Earth's sky. However, in order to experience the stated time dilation, the planet would have to be so close to Gargantua that the event horizon would fill *half the sky*. Nolan wanted to save close-up imagery of the event horizon for the climax of the film, so he overrode Kip Thorne and instead depicted the planet as further away than it actually is.

A clear sky on Miller‚Äôs world would truly be a spectacular sight. One half of the sky would be pitch black ‚Äì the event horizon ‚Äì and the other half would be a twisted starfield spinning *ten times a second* (thanks to time dilation, from your perspective, the planet orbits Gargantua in a tenth of a second) along with the accretion disk forming a massive arc of light stretching across the sky.

Just wanted to point out something I noticed on my last watch that I hadn't really thought of, I suppose I internalized it, so it did come across to me but I just never made the connection.

Nolan shows us in the fight scene between Mann and Coop that Mann is more than just a coward for not accepting his own death, he is actually too cowardly to watch Coop die after essentially killing him, and can't even listen to the sound of it. 

I think this squeamishness on his part is actually somewhat tied to his conscience, part of his inability to watch Coop die is his own overwhelming instinct to save him. This tiny shred of humanity left inside Mann actually ends up saving the crew and humanity and killing Mann in the process, as his inability to watch, or even listen to Coop die precluded his clean escape.",2025-01-05 22:36:30,335,0,-0.9944,-1,-1,1.0

In the scene on board Lander 1 when Cooper and Brand are chasing Mann enroute to docking with the Endurance, TARS notifies the crew that it disabled Manns autopilot system a while ago, out of caution. Cooper then asks TARS what it's Trust setting is, to which it replies ""Lower than yours, Apparently""

First of all it's brilliant to me how Nolan depicted these two insanely smart AI systems in the movie. Its a refreshingly positive take on AI in the wake of contemporary AI negativity. Its also amazing that TARS doubted Mann almost instantly but didn't inform the rest of the crew about it and decided to directly act on its suspicion with an abundance of caution.

If TARS hadn't disabled the autopilot, Mann would have successfully docked with Endurance and left Cooper and Brand to die without fuel. Later in the film, TARS was already aware of Coopers plan to sacrifice himself to save Brand but didn't let her know about it until it was too late for her to change anything. Subsequently, without TARS present within the Tesserect structure, Cooper would have never been able to translate the quantum data to Morse. I think the Bulk Beings respected TARS a lot as they also left it undamaged and returned it to the solar system with Cooper (although with a damaged battery). 

To me, this robot is the MVP of the movie.

1997: Donald Cooper is Born.

2019: A wormhole is Discovered orbiting around Saturn.

2032: Joseph Cooper is Born.

2052: Thomas Cooper is Born.

10 February 2056: TARS Goes Haywire in Cooper's Ship, which is Somewhere in the Stratosphere, leading him to Crash.

28 June 2057: Murphy Cooper is born.

2057: The Lazarus Missions Launch.

15 April 2067: In the Opening Scene of Interstellar, Cooper relives ""The Crash"" in his Sleep, and Murph wakes him up. Cooper goes to Parent-teacher conferences, at which Murph gets a suspension, to her Surprise. A Baseball  game is underway, as A Dust storm is rolling off the Grand Canyon... and it reaches them. Murph sees something strange, as the Sand is in Perfect Columns. This leads to the Coordinates to NASA. At night, They arrive at NASA, where Cooper gets Tazed at the Gates. TARS approaches the Truck Cooper drives to get there, much to Murphy's Horror.

16 April 2067: When Cooper comes to, he is Confused, and only ONE Person is on Cooper's Mind. Let me Demonstrate:

COOPER: \[wakes up\]

TARS: ""How did you Find this Place?""

COOPER: ""Where's my Daughter?""

TARS: ""You had the Coordinates for this Facility marked on your map. Where did you get those Coordinates?""

COOPER: ""WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER!!!???""

Amelia Brand appears, introducing herself, assuring him that Murph is Okay. Cooper says, albeit in a flirtatious way, that he knows a Dr. Brand, except he was a Professor, and Not Nearly ""As cute."" Cooper is Explained about the Mission, and is told that they are the Same NASA He flew for. Professor Brand explains him all the Details of the Mission, eventually Convincing him to go along with them. At night, back at his house, Cooper and Donald drink Beer, and talk over what's about to Happen.

17 April 2067: Cooper tries to Calm down an Inconsolable Murph in any way Possible. It doesn't work. Cooper reassures her that he is Coming Back, says Good-bye to Tom, tells Donald to Look after his Children, and Before you Know it, They are in Space. Eventually, they Escape Earth's Orbit. They go into Hypersleep.

18 December 2067: Around 8 Months after their Departure from Earth, they use Mars as a Gravitational Slingshot.

20 February 2069: 14 Months after their Slingshot around Mars, The Crew wakes up from Hypersleep, and they Enter the Wormhole. Once they arrive at Miller's Planet, they realize that the Time Dilation Factor is 61,320. In other words, Every Hour on Miller's Planet is 7 Years on Earth. Once They Land, they Realize Miller has No land, and they Realize Miller's Lander is Nothing but Wreckage at this Point. They go Towards the ""Mountains,"" only to Find out that they are NOT Mountains, they are waves. The Wave that Brand walks towards is Moving away from them, and that can Mean ONE Thing and ONE Thing only: Given the wave's Distance away from them, Another wave is Practically on top of them. Cooper warns them of an upcoming wave, and The wave kills Doyle. It'll take almost an Hour for the Engines to Drain. When it DOES, However, they just BARELY Miss a Third wave.

28 June 2092: They arrive back on the Endurance to a Greyed Romilly. Cooper has Messages stored for him, all of which are from Tom -- all but one, and this one is Live. It's MURPH!!! Although she is an adult now, She explains that today is her Birthday, one that makes her just as old as him. Amelia is Seen watching a Message from Professor Brand. After this Message is done, The Crew Talk about there Next Option:

COOPER: ""Tars kept the Endurance Right where we Needed her, but the Trip took Years longer than We Anticipated. We No Longer have the Fuel to Visit both Prospects, so we Have to Choose.""

After some Quarreling about How Brand was Using Subjectivity to choose their Next Target, they Choose Dr. Mann's Planet. On their way, in the Embryo Lab, Brand tells Cooper that HE Will have to Choose between a Journey to Edmund's planet or a Return Journey to Earth Next time Around.

Late 2092: The Scene switches to Murph, now working at NASA, Running to an Elderly Professor Brand on his Deathbed. He Tells her the Following:

PROF. BRAND: I let you all down.

MURPH: No, you got us so Far! Real Close!

PROF. BRAND: ... I wanted you to Believe that your Father would come back.

MURPH: I do, Professor.

PROF. BRAND: Forgive me, Murph.

MURPH: There's nothing to Forgive.

PROF. BRAND: I lied, Murph. I lied to you. There was No need for him to Come back. There was No way to Help us.

MURPH: But all this, All these People, and the Equation. Did my Father know? Did he Leave me?

PROF. BRAND: ...Do ...Not ...Go ...Gentle...

And with that, Professor Brand died. Shocked, Murph exited the Room, and sent a Message to the Crew on the Endurance. But case is the Only one who got it, for now, as the Rest of the Crew Left for the Surface of Dr. Mann's planet, which they were now in Orbit around.

Upon arriving on Dr. Mann's Planet, They woke up Dr. Mann, who Broke down in Tears, because he was So Happy he saw another Human Being. The Crew told Dr. Mann about the Mission so far, and Dr. Mann told them that at the Surface the Ammonia gives way to ""Crystalline Hydrocarbons,"" and ""Breathable air, even to life."" Dr. Mann offers him an Expedition to the Probe landing Sites, and They set off.

After arriving at the ""Surface,"" Dr. Mann flicks off Cooper's Transmitter, and Shoves him down to the Ground. Cooper says: ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING???""

MANN: ""I'm Sorry! I can't let you leave with that Ship. We're gonna need it to Complete the Mission. Once the Others Realize what this Place isn't, We Cannot Survive Here. I'm Sorry! I'm Sorry!""

With That, Cooper almost Gets stabbed in the Arm by what Looks like Metal Spikes on Dr. Mann's Boots. Cooper Grapples onto Something with... Something,  and Releases... Something, Probably Air, which Somehow makes Both of them Tumble towards the ""Surface."" At this Time, Dr. Mann tells Cooper Everything, Including the fact that the Planet has No Surface.

And then they Wrestle, on the Top of Frozen Clouds, on a Planet... With No Surface. During the Brawl, One of them Releases a Great Deal of Air out of the Other Person's Tank, Via his Arm, and Cooper Says: ""STOP IT!!!"" Dr. Mann Pounds on Cooper's Helmet several Times, and Cooper Pleads for him to Stop. As he Pleads this, Dr. Mann Pounds on his Helmet more. After Cooper tells him what is At Stake, Dr. Mann gives one Final Blow to Cooper's Helmet, which Happens to Bust it Open. As Cooper is Writhing and Choking, Mann says: ""Don't Judge me, Cooper. You were Never Tested like I  was. Few men Have been.""

Here's what Happened back on Earth During all of This. Dr. Getty does a Check-up on Coop Which Tom walks in on, And they Dr. Getty tells him that Earth is No Longer Habitable, and that they, along with Everyone Left on Earth, should probably Leave. This Angers Tom, who Punches Doctor Getty. After some Quarreling, Murph tells Tom that he Is Risking the Death of his Own Child. This Infuriates Tom, who Demands her to ""Get out. And don't Come back."" As Murph Leaves, She tells Coop to Leave her Stuff. She drives off into a Road with what Looks like People who Also know what is Happening. She Torches Some of Tom's Crops. Tom notices the Blazing of his Crops on the Horizon, And he Gathers his Farm-workers to Try and Put it out.

Meanwhile, on Dr. Mann's Planet, Dr. Mann is watching Cooper die, but Leaves, because he Doesn't have it in him to Do so. As Cooper sits up, he is Still Choking on Ammonia, and He's Looking around for his Mic Piece. Dr. Mann assumes that Cooper sees his Children. He Recites the Dylan Thomas Poem that Prof. Brand recited when Cooper Left Earth. As this Happens, Cooper spots his Mic Piece, still intact. Dr. Mann takes his Mic Piece out, when Cooper Puts his in. When Cooper does this, Dr. Brand hears a Cry for Help from Cooper. She tells CASE To wait up, and when Dr. Brand is on Board, CASE Tells her that he Has a Signal from Cooper's Transmitter, and They Use that to Spot Cooper. But before they Can, Cooper sees His Children, which can Mean one thing and ONE Thing only: Cooper is Dying. But Dr. Brand sees him, and Cooper sticks his Arm up. She Rushes towards Cooper with an Inhaler, and As they Both are on the Lander, Cooper tells Her that Dr. Mann was Lying.

Meanwhile, in the Compound, Romilly, at TARS's Request, Unlocks KIPP with his Fingerprint. As he Does that, He Gets an Incoming Message:

BRAND: ""Romilly?! Do you Read me? Romilly?""

TARS: ""STEP BACK, PROFESSOR!!! STEP BA--""

And It all goes to Hell. Dr. Mann sees his Compound Explode from Afar, leading Him to Steal the Ranger. As the Lander makes it to What's Left of the Compound, TARS Runs out, and when He Gets into the Ranger, He Informs the Crew of Romilly's Death. As Dr. Mann is pushing into Orbit, He Docks to the Endurance Imperfectly, with Disregard to the Crew's Pleas. He Tries to Override Hatch Lockout, which he Succeeds, Manually.

After Brand Broadcasts a Warning to Dr. Mann, He Disregards it, And Unlocks the Door, Causing the Airlock to Depressurize, Leading to A Chain Reaction that Kills Dr. Mann Instantly, and Explodes a Good Chunk of the Endurance, causing it to Spin Uncontrollably, and Plummet to the ""Surface"". Cooper makes a Last-Ditch attempt to Dock to the Spacecraft by Matching the Lander's Spin to that of the Endurance, something that CASE Deems Impossible, But Cooper Deems Necessary. After Successfully doing So, they Just so Happen to Slip Directly into the Pull of Gargantua.

At this point, They Find a Plan to Detach TARS to Lessen the Weight of the Endurance, and to Use as Much Fuel as they Can. According to Cooper, this Amount of Fuel will Be Too much to use Enough to Get to Edmund's Planet Later. So he Uses a Gravitational Assist to Slingshot them to Edmund's Planet.

2143: According to Cooper's Calculations, The Slingshot took 51 Years on Earth, even though it Took Merely 11 Minutes and 20 Seconds to Them, which means that the Time Dilation Factor was 2.4 Million. At this time, TARS Detaches, and So Does Cooper. Dr. Brand Pleads Coper not to Do this, saying ""You told me there were Enough Resources for the Both of Us."" Cooper Tells her ""We Agreed, Amelia. Ninety Percent. Detach."" Indicating that He was Lying. After this, Brand Leaves Gargantua to Go to Edmund's Planet. Once she Arrives, She Finds that Edmund is Dead. So she starts Building a Colony.

BEYOND TIME: After Falling into the Black Hole, Cooper Falls into a Tesseract in the Singularity of Gargantua. He doesn't know what it is yet, But he sees Murph, and writes the STAY Message. After Hearing TARS On the Radio, He Explains to Him where they are, which then Leads him to Transmit the Coordinates of NASA Into Binary, and the Data Needed to Complete the Equation of Quantum Gravity over the Second Hand of the Watch while Using Morse. The Tesseract Closes, which means that it Worked. Humanity is Saved. He Reaches out to Touch Amelia's Hand.

2156: Upon Exiting the Wormhole, Cooper is Knocked Unconscious, and Flashing Lights appear in the Distance. The Rangers Pick him Up with only Minutes left in his Oxygen Supply. He Awoke in a Hospital Bed in a Space Station orbiting Saturn, called Cooper's Station, Named after Murph. After Cooper is Released from the Hospital, He sees his Daughter, A 99-year-old Murph, for the Final Time. He was Told to Go Find Brand, who She Thinks is Going into Hypersleep. Cooper Steals a Ranger, and Sets off into the Unknown.",2023-10-09 15:47:29,312,0,-0.9985,-1,-1,1.0

I‚Äôve had this tradition since 2015. Every New Years Eve, at 9pm I begin Interstellar. It finishes around 11:45pm and I sit for 15 minutes until it‚Äôs the New Year. I used to watch it by myself but have since watched it with my wife and siblings.

2015 was the worst year of my life and I went to go visit my brother to get away from everything. He suggested that I watch ‚Äúthis new space film‚Äù (since I love science fiction and space) and as soon as we finished it, I was hooked. 

I spent the next three weeks staying up until 2am researching all I could about the film, time dilation, black holes, and space. I even read some work of Kip Thorne. I think this obsession saved my life. 2015 was the year that all that could go bad did go bad. I was severely depressed, lost, and contemplated suicide. This movie saved my life because if I did not spend my nights obsessing over it, I think I would have prevented myself from waking up in the morning. I only woke up so I could read about the film and its contents more.

Everything about this movie is mesmerizing. The cinematography, score, lines, acting. But what I appreciate most is the theme that ‚Äòlove is the only thing that can transcend both time and space‚Äô ‚Äî that stuck with me. Even in my moments of despair I knew that out there, somewhere, someone loved me. I knew that I mattered (to my parents, friends, etc). even if I didn‚Äôt feel like I did. And that was enough for me.

Each year I watch Interstellar to remind me of how far I have come and I hope one day to meet anyone associated with this movie and its creation so I can thank them for saving my life. 

If you have a spare few hours on New Years Eve, I welcome you to join me in my annual viewing at 9pm on December 31st. We may not know each other but we can still experience a film through time and space together.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt expect such a positive response. As such, I‚Äôve started a subreddit (r/Interstellar_NYE) dedicated to a virtual viewing party on New Years Eve. It‚Äôs an open invitation for anyone.",2022-12-03 04:03:38,311,0,0.943,1,1,1.0

2788,interstellar,"There is no paradox in Interstellar.

Most people, after seeing the movie, came to this conclusion:

How can there be a wormhole that the crew goes through in the first place if the only way NASA learns how to make a wormhole is by Cooper being in the black hole and relaying the data to Murph via the Tesseract? How did the initial wormhole come into existence?

Well the answer is this:

So imagine this scenario: Prof. Brand and the NASA team are trying to figure out Plan A but they can't solve the equation. Originally there is no wormhole, and they are stuck on Earth as the blight is happening. Brand sends a team of astronauts and robots on a ship and travel to Gargantua without a wormhole (it just takes hundreds of millions of years). During this time they are in hibernation. They finally arrive on the planet, colonize, and send a probe into the black hole that relays the data to solve Plan A. After a long enough time of living on Gargantua, they evolve into 5D beings, and using the data from the probe in the black hole, they create the wormhole. Since it's 5D, they can go back and change events (time is not linear anymore). They make the wormhole, place it near Saturn, and then the events in the movie play out as we see them. This way there isn't a paradox, because the wormhole was not constructed out of thin air. 

This fits well with the movie's tagline: ""Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here"". Originally, mankind did die on planet Earth except for the select few that made it to Gargantua and colonized the remaining humans. It was only after evolving into 5D beings that they could go back and prevent mankind from perishing on Earth. The tagline is alluding to this theory because mankind did originally die on Earth, but eventually they went back after evolving to prevent mankind from dying on Earth in the first place.

Hope this makes sense to all of you. It took me two days of confusion to come up with this theory.

EDIT: This is just a theory to give myself some closure. Believe whatever you want; after all Nolan is famous for ambiguity. Cough cough Inception cough cough. Having said that, Interstellar is still in my top five list. 9.5/10 would recommend.",2014-11-09 23:17:12,304,0,0.6891,1,1,1.0

Let's suspend our disbelief for a moment and guess that they visited Miller's planet the day the film came out -  October 26, 2014. Doyle takes a bit of a wave ride but wearing the suit, maybe he's just knocked unconscious. The ten year anniversary is coming up for Interstellar. 

NASA astronauts have about 6 to 8 hours of oxygen for a spacewalk and Interstellar is in a the future a bit so maybe the suits have improved - let's say 10 hours. If you don't buy that we can even go down to 5 due to their slimmer fit than NASA suits. 

Regardless, if all this were true, Doyle has only been on Miller's Planet for 1 hour and 17 minutes as of this very moment. So he wakes up with a hell of a headache. And let's go with the lower end of the spectrum that the suit has only 5 hours of oxygen. That leaves Doyle 3 hours and 43 minutes of oxygen. Which gives us 21 years and 9 months to save him.

After seeing 3 showings in this past week and at least my 10th watch I just now noticed the quick pan to Doyle after the aggressive ranger landing on Millers Plant to save fuel. I now believe Doyle knew Plan B was the only option from the start and that Professor Brands equation wouldn't work without going into Gargantua and relaying the Quantum Data. This along with him saying ""You have to think bigger than that"" to Cooper about returning to Earth makes me really question Doyle

Obviously the black hole in Interstellar was modeled through far more intricate programming, but it‚Äôs cool to see what a beginner can do on a free program. Post processing in Lightroom/Photoshop.

Hey, welcome to r/InterstellarArt

This sticky post is to help make some information about the sub more visible, but please ask any questions you have here too!

We're looking forward to seeing your space art :D

Please check out our full rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/rules).

Main rules:

**Art must be space art** \- Art that focuses on or contains elements of space; astronauts, stars, planets, nebulas, galaxies, space travel, aliens, auroras, and so on.

**Please credit** \- Even if you are the artist, please let us know. You deserve the credit, hopefully it discourages stealing and karma farming, let a mod know if you spot this. [How to credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/crediting); basically pop \[OC\] in your title (the actual OC tag can't be seen on mobile yet). If you forget the bot should remind you and you an add it in comments.

If posting someone else's work please also xpost or link to their work.

**No flooding the sub** \- Please don't flood the sub with your work. It can be exiting to find a new place to share, but so that everyone has a chance to be seen and to maintain some variety on the main page, don't post more than 3 times in 24hrs.

It has been announced that the OC tag is going to be depreciated. Once this happens you will no longer be able to use it to tag your art as Original Content.

**How does that impact you and this community?**

It means you'll need to make sure to add \[OC\] or some form of appropriate credit in your post (preferably in the title) and you won't be able to add it after posting, except in comments, and nor will the mods.

###Would you like to moderate here?

We'd love a new mod or two! At the moment the workload isn‚Äôt much, however it‚Äôs always a good idea to have more mods than you need ready for more growth or spikes in activity, so I‚Äôm looking to add a few depending on how the applications go.

Here is what we expect from applicants:

* Willingness to learn moderation specific to this community 
* Ability to work well in a team and independently
* Time to commit to moderating 
* Acceptance of a trial period if we take you on
* An interest in the topic of the community

##[Application Form](https://forms.gle/rhTjFNekXys5D3Yr6)

If you have any questions, please reach out though [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InterstellarArt).

I am recruiting for a few communities around the same time, and will leave applications open a while, so it may take me a while to respond to applications (if interested in applying elsewhere, I will be making posts on those communities in the near future).

It's come up a few times if characters from 'space' media are allowed here. So we're asking you and will go with community on this.

Hi I‚Äôm new to painting in general but I really enjoy art that involves the night sky, space, stuff like that and I was wondering if I wanted to paint a space scenery or whatever would I just paint the whole canvas black and let it dry before adding the color so that way if I start painting with purple it doesn‚Äôt just get mixed in with the black or do I just do it all at once? If this is confusing I apologize and I‚Äôd be happy to try and explain it better",2020-04-14 07:38:23,5,0,0.9527,1,1,1.0

Hi all

The creator of the sub deleted their account, so I've snagged it and hope to grow it. 

I've grown subs before, but I could use a hand: I need someone who preferably has an affinity for space, art, or both. And who has lots of time and willingness to advertise and find content.

I can provide guidelines and templates on where to look, what to say etc. Possibly a good learning opportunity for someone looking to start modding and who wants to know how to get a sub going.

Please pm if interested, I'll get back to you after the Xmas madness. Thanks :)",2019-12-23 15:01:28,2,0,0.9815,1,1,1.0

Hello! Welcome to r/InterstellarArt! I'm u/Bujuto2986, the original creator of r/InterstellarArt and I'll tell you what you need to know about this subreddit: 

1. r/InterstellarArt is a place where you can draw artwork about spacey stuff. That includes planets, moons, stars, black holes and more (Though I wouldn't try drawing a realistic black hole)! You can also post artwork from other people if you come across it, just no reposts.
2. Be kind to each other and basically have good reddiquette.
3. Have fun! This is a place of imagination, let your dreams run wild and draw YOUR part of the Universe!

Other than those 3 things, this subreddit is yours!

It has been announced that the OC tag is going to be depreciated. Once this happens you will no longer be able to use it to tag your art as Original Content.

**How does that impact you and this community?**

It means you'll need to make sure to add \[OC\] or some form of appropriate credit in your post (preferably in the title) and you won't be able to add it after posting, except in comments, and nor will the mods.

###Would you like to moderate here?

We'd love a new mod or two! At the moment the workload isn‚Äôt much, however it‚Äôs always a good idea to have more mods than you need ready for more growth or spikes in activity, so I‚Äôm looking to add a few depending on how the applications go.

Here is what we expect from applicants:

* Willingness to learn moderation specific to this community 
* Ability to work well in a team and independently
* Time to commit to moderating 
* Acceptance of a trial period if we take you on
* An interest in the topic of the community

##[Application Form](https://forms.gle/rhTjFNekXys5D3Yr6)

If you have any questions, please reach out though [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InterstellarArt).

I am recruiting for a few communities around the same time, and will leave applications open a while, so it may take me a while to respond to applications (if interested in applying elsewhere, I will be making posts on those communities in the near future).

Hi I‚Äôm new to painting in general but I really enjoy art that involves the night sky, space, stuff like that and I was wondering if I wanted to paint a space scenery or whatever would I just paint the whole canvas black and let it dry before adding the color so that way if I start painting with purple it doesn‚Äôt just get mixed in with the black or do I just do it all at once?

Hey, welcome to r/InterstellarArt

This sticky post is to help make some information about the sub more visible, but please ask any questions you have here too!

We're looking forward to seeing your space art :D

Please check out our full rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/rules).

Main rules:

**Art must be space art** \- Art that focuses on or contains elements of space; astronauts, stars, planets, nebulas, galaxies, space travel, aliens, auroras, and so on.

**Please credit** \- Even if you are the artist, please let us know. You deserve the credit, hopefully it discourages stealing and karma farming, let a mod know if you spot this. [How to credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/crediting); basically pop \[OC\] in your title (the actual OC tag can't be seen on mobile yet). If you forget the bot should remind you and you an add it in comments.

If posting someone else's work please also xpost or link to their work.

**No flooding the sub** \- Please don't flood the sub with your work. It can be exiting to find a new place to share, but so that everyone has a chance to be seen and to maintain some variety on the main page, don't post more than 3 times in 24hrs.

Hi all

The creator of the sub deleted their account, so I've snagged it and hope to grow it. 

I've grown subs before, but I could use a hand: I need someone who preferably has an affinity for space, art, or both. And who has lots of time and willingness to advertise and find content.

I can provide guidelines and templates on where to look, what to say etc. Possibly a good learning opportunity for someone looking to start modding and who wants to know how to get a sub going.

Please pm if interested, I'll get back to you after the Xmas madness. Thanks :)",2019-12-23 15:01:28,2,0,0.9815,1,1,1.0

Hello! Welcome to r/InterstellarArt! I'm u/Bujuto2986, the original creator of r/InterstellarArt and I'll tell you what you need to know about this subreddit: 

1. r/InterstellarArt is a place where you can draw artwork about spacey stuff. That includes planets, moons, stars, black holes and more (Though I wouldn't try drawing a realistic black hole)! You can also post artwork from other people if you come across it, just no reposts.
2. Be kind to each other and basically have good reddiquette.
3. Have fun! This is a place of imagination, let your dreams run wild and draw YOUR part of the Universe!

Other than those 3 things, this subreddit is yours!

Happy drawing!",2019-10-17 06:54:00,4,0,0.9728,1,1,1.0

It's come up a few times if characters from 'space' media are allowed here. So we're asking you and will go with community on this.

Are characters from space films, TV series', etc 'spacey' enough for r/InterstellarArt?

Hey, welcome to r/InterstellarArt

This sticky post is to help make some information about the sub more visible, but please ask any questions you have here too!

We're looking forward to seeing your space art :D

Please check out our full rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/rules).

Main rules:

**Art must be space art** \- Art that focuses on or contains elements of space; astronauts, stars, planets, nebulas, galaxies, space travel, aliens, auroras, and so on.

**Please credit** \- Even if you are the artist, please let us know. You deserve the credit, hopefully it discourages stealing and karma farming, let a mod know if you spot this. [How to credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterstellarArt/wiki/index/crediting); basically pop \[OC\] in your title (the actual OC tag can't be seen on mobile yet). If you forget the bot should remind you and you an add it in comments.

If posting someone else's work please also xpost or link to their work.

**No flooding the sub** \- Please don't flood the sub with your work. It can be exiting to find a new place to share, but so that everyone has a chance to be seen and to maintain some variety on the main page, don't post more than 3 times in 24hrs.

It has been announced that the OC tag is going to be depreciated. Once this happens you will no longer be able to use it to tag your art as Original Content.

**How does that impact you and this community?**

It means you'll need to make sure to add \[OC\] or some form of appropriate credit in your post (preferably in the title) and you won't be able to add it after posting, except in comments, and nor will the mods.

###Would you like to moderate here?

We'd love a new mod or two! At the moment the workload isn‚Äôt much, however it‚Äôs always a good idea to have more mods than you need ready for more growth or spikes in activity, so I‚Äôm looking to add a few depending on how the applications go.

Here is what we expect from applicants:

* Willingness to learn moderation specific to this community 
* Ability to work well in a team and independently
* Time to commit to moderating 
* Acceptance of a trial period if we take you on
* An interest in the topic of the community

##[Application Form](https://forms.gle/rhTjFNekXys5D3Yr6)

If you have any questions, please reach out though [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InterstellarArt).

I am recruiting for a few communities around the same time, and will leave applications open a while, so it may take me a while to respond to applications (if interested in applying elsewhere, I will be making posts on those communities in the near future).

Hi I‚Äôm new to painting in general but I really enjoy art that involves the night sky, space, stuff like that and I was wondering if I wanted to paint a space scenery or whatever would I just paint the whole canvas black and let it dry before adding the color so that way if I start painting with purple it doesn‚Äôt just get mixed in with the black or do I just do it all at once?

1. r/InterstellarArt is a place where you can draw artwork about spacey stuff. That includes planets, moons, stars, black holes and more (Though I wouldn't try drawing a realistic black hole)! You can also post artwork from other people if you come across it, just no reposts.
2. Be kind to each other and basically have good reddiquette.
3. Have fun! This is a place of imagination, let your dreams run wild and draw YOUR part of the Universe!

Other than those 3 things, this subreddit is yours!

Happy drawing!",2019-10-17 06:54:00,4,0,0.9728,1,1,1.0

Hi all

The creator of the sub deleted their account, so I've snagged it and hope to grow it. 

I've grown subs before, but I could use a hand: I need someone who preferably has an affinity for space, art, or both. And who has lots of time and willingness to advertise and find content.

I can provide guidelines and templates on where to look, what to say etc. Possibly a good learning opportunity for someone looking to start modding and who wants to know how to get a sub going.

Please pm if interested, I'll get back to you after the Xmas madness. Thanks :)",2019-12-23 15:01:28,2,0,0.9815,1,1,1.0

As you may know, both games have been taken down from the Google Play Store, likely due to policies regarding developer inactivity.

Homeworld mobile filled that gap, but after backing and supporting that game by purchasing the supporter packs on closed beta, that game shuts down too. I can't programm. I can't write code. But I can plan, put a design together and make a proposal. I'm also a very experienced alpha and beta tester. I know it's alot to‚Äã ask, but maybe the community would help me make this a reality? I wish I could say I could pay people, but I don't even know where to begin with that. I would love to make this a side project with a few people to do in our spare time, no matter how slow or long it takes.

Hey Y‚Äôall! Joined the sub today. Huge fan of the game, IP2 has so many cool features.

Scrolling through the sub, I enjoy a lot of the folks saying that they‚Äôd like to see the devs use much more of the game assets. They got me thinking‚Ä¶

What if the tractor beams were given an additional function to be able to pull wormholes, and cause either cataclysmic system end or temporal reality shift? In the case of the reality shift, rename stations, change the control of the sector from allies to enemies etc.?

about the physics of that, I just have questions. is it a matter of ship speed? Speed over 40 or 50; is it a matter of ship acceleration while latched onto wormhole? 

I think it‚Äôd be sick to see it work with a timer added counting you down to kind of escape before the sector collapses on itself lol. Also, encourages gameplay in smaller, faster ships!! Only perhaps! Cheers! üçª ",2024-10-09 20:12:20,7,0,0.947,1,1,1.0

6211,InterstellarPilots,"Interstellar Pilot Mod 2.0.52 (released & unofficial)

# The IP2 v2.0.52 Rebalance Mod features the following:

* Performance improvements for low end devices which will aid tremendously in stability causing less crashes while playing large sectors.  Space fog has been completely disabled as well as the ""glob"" wormholes
* Sandbox Universe allows to create 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 sector count for custom universe play
* Sector sizes have been increased to 32k units; this makes for a much better ""space"" feeling while playing in a sector as well as it makes for a more tactical game-play to fortify a players stronghold within a sector
* All Ships & Stations have been re-scaled
* All Ships have been re-balanced
* All Stations have increased Hulls and Cargo
* All Weapons have been re-balanced
* All Shields, Capacitors, Engines & Generators have been re-balanced
* Stations can now equip larger Generators, Capacitors and Shields
* All non-essential bays are opened (essential bays are bays required for the ship to function as well as for special orders to take place such as mining orders & passenger transport orders)
* All Artillery are long-ranged weapons and require a minimum firing distance to use.  This creates a more TACTICAL STYLE of game-play.
* Lasers now miss; no more laser spamming from the NPCs or the Player just to win ... a fighter can now outmaneuver lasers and actually dog-fight.  Playing on full zoom in a fighter makes the game very immersive.
* Scratch cards give rewards; this is for the non-god-mode players so they can use it as a ""cheat"" for quick and easy credits
* Fixed the issue where NPCs would outfit their ships & stations with cloaks.  Basically the cloaking device is set back to its own unique bay, and only the X variants will be able to properly use it (as they should be only for the X variants).  All other variants will just have a free extra open bay; if the ship came pre-loaded with a cloak it might be there but it will not allow to be re-added if sold to non-X variants.
* Satellite scan range has been increased where 1 single satellite is enough to scan the entire sector.  The hull has been increased as well.
* Description text information screens have been updated so weapons will read their minimum & maximum firing ranges.
* All ""coming soon"" scenarios have been unlocked; now a player can enjoy the developers scenarios as they are fully accesible to play.
* All new Orion mesh, dubbed the Broadsword (no more clunky models in-game).
* Brand new Laser V; the most powerful of all weapons with long-reload time.  Only available for Overlord, Magnus & Stations (unless using the in-game cheat menu can equip on any ship).
* Mission payouts have been re-balance
* Might be forgetting what else changed ... but that's all can remember

Have fun and hope the mod is enjoyed by the community.

Cheers!

Hello, I'm new to Interstellar pilot 2 and kinda have a problem with automating my stations.

Station cargo is fine, plenty of room. And my Trade Station is well a trade station, it's got one heck of a cargohold. It always needs to be micro-managed and I admit it becomes kinda tedious.

Noticed the ships died in the glitched fleet (engine no work, can't turn, don't take orders, etc.) Luckily it wasn't that far back so I loaded an earlier save.

Also, I think the way you do the glitch may be to assign a bunch of ships to the fleet at once cause when ships are doing the ""join fleet"" task they technically aren't part of the fleet yet so you can make multiple ships join the fleet before the fleet number updates.

The GunStar is purely offensive. Player should be in the driver seat. Lots of reloading. On the plus side, this vessel is a nightmare for the enemy. I've actually had the game stop playing against me twice while engaging with this craft. 

The Outlander is a fantastic defense craft. It's great for defending high value property, never needs rearming and is fun to take into combat. Her armament allows her to face a variety of threats and she's more than competent in offensive engagements.

The Meteor is one of my newest vessels. She just kinda ""happened"" one day. You'll notice the laser IV configuration. This actually increases her rate of fire.

So first of all i understand that to improve relation i do thier missions/jobs and don't attack thier ships. But one time i accidentally attacked a faction but i quickly paid it off when it was only some credits. 
The thing i didn't realised is that after a while they broke the truce and attacked my ships in another sector. I thought it was some bandits (I didn't look at the inbox notificatiosns) so my ship repelled and destroyed them and the relation only got worse but i paid it off after some days when i saw they were attacking my station.
But they again broke the truce and i had to destroy their whole fleet and a station because although i paid for the truce they still attacked and so did my ships and truce broke.
After killing them all i again made truce but saw that it was some 700k credits but still paid it off and they were on red relation. Although i never attacked them they continued to break the truce and i can't pay 700k every single time. And now I can't even do thier missions to increase relation. I don't want to kill every single one of them (i can't) and i had earlier good trade routes going through thier sectors and war doesn't allow me to trade with farway sectors which i am dependent on for credits.

How many traders is too much or is it just the more the better?

Do i need to pick a base for traders, passenger transport, patrol, i know how to use it on miners but does that do anything important on other roles?

Are missle launcher great? Do you recomend using them or putting them on your fleet? If yes then what is the best type of missle to load and are there any specific ship that are especially good for using missles?

Does buying an EQ ship do anything? I remember buying a magnus EQ and order it to trade but not totally sure if it was worth it.

How to capture a station effectively? When i tried to capture one i blew it up instead but when my hornet swarm do it they capture it, even my magnus crew with laser 5 did it too, what am i doing wrong?

Hey everyone, I am curious as to what your favorite variants are to use in various situations.

I use a lot of mid-level overlords with bursters. I find that the burster's balance of moderate chance to hit with mid-level efficiency gives it overall utility against a variety of enemies. Usually, I put one Overlord-A with all proton burst III and a 120 generator in a fleet with 7 Flyer-A armed with all Proton Burst I. Since they are typically chasing the enemy their proton shots seem to be a lot more accurate against small enemies than the overlord, so once I can afford it I switch to a laser build on the overload-A. 

Late game, I tend to make fleets of:

1 - Magnus-A with three wide arc laser V and the rest of the smaller angle turrets equipped with laser III or IV, with two Anti-missiles on its two 360-degree turret slots. 

2 - Overlord-A with wide-angle laser V and the more narrow-angle turrets at laser III or IV. The rear turrets have laser III.

2 - Creon-A with proton burst III on wide angle and Plasma III on narrow-angle slots. Since these can only have weaker generators, capped at 52, I try to only use the more energy-efficient weapons on them.

3 - Ares-A with complete photon burst builds.

Since the Ares seem to work a lot better than the Creons, I've been tempted to go with 5 Areas and completely stop using the Creons outside of Currier missions.

6303,InterstellarPilots,"A suggestion to help lower spec systems

Hello again everyone,

Once I start to control about 1/4 or so of a 64-sector game, my computer starts to take 2+ minutes to find a trade route for any one fleet. It appears that the way the game calculates those routes can backlog in order to keep the frame rate up, which is a great thing as it can catch up when less fleets are finishing their runs, and queue when more fleets have recently finished a run.

However, for lower-spec systems in never catches up. 

I was wondering, is there any way to modify the code to allow the computer to catch up while the game is paused?

I often pause to check my maps when bandits pop up in several systems at once or to upgrade multiple buildings that just finished. However, that appears to pause all background computing as well, including trade route selection.

Greetings once again, pilots. I was wandering around the components of my upgraded Ares escorts for my Magnus and I discovered that its capacitor's capacity shows 1,800/1,800 even though I've only just installed the 1.7k capacitor onto it which is also the max supported by those ships (surely it's just supposed to show 1,700/1,700 right?). Anyway, I can find this to be useful for some cases especially when it comes to sustained combat, my Ares could potentially fire one more Laser III shot before draining its capacitor to the minimum.

6329,InterstellarPilots,"Ships uncloaking automatically?

Why does the cloaking mechanism of Interstellar Pilot 2 automatically uncloacks ships when they take damage while they are on the process of cloacking? I've only observed this on Small Cloak devices, no matter what level it is, it still happens. I find it devastating when I'm on a fight and suddenly, the enemy decided to target lock and surround me, I pop it my level 4 version of the small cloak device that also has 50% damage reduction while cloaking/uncloaking in hopes of switching their targets on one of my other ships but as I do so, with their weapons still firing at me, my ship automatically uncloaks itself while playing the uncloak sound in the process, my hull health is now down to orange much faster than if I haven't cloak in the first place. Anyone else experience this? I don't know if it is the same case on the cloaks used for capital ships as I don't typically equip them with one.

The 1st game of Interstellar Pilot does not do this as far as I can tell. Don't get me started on detectable cloaked ships as long as you are within 250 units from them or so. Is the nerf of the cloaking system on this 2nd game that bad? State your opinion as well in the comments down below.

Hello all, 
I recently downloaded IP 2 after playing the first one a few years ago and I have a few questions with the new game that I am curious about.

1. Does the sentinel turret have a 360 degree view even if it is put on a weapon slot with limited angles? (Like how the military launcher can be put on any slot and work fine

2. Do lasers do the same damage if they are only charged halfway vs fully? I know in the old version they did the same damage.

3. What does efficiency mean on the stat card of weapons? Is it the damage/energy cost ratio?

4. I noticed that there isn‚Äôt any option to repair a station or it‚Äôs modules. I know that there is auto repair for the station but is there any way to repair the modules or do I have to sell and rebuy each damaged module to get them back to 100%",2023-07-25 06:13:08,8,0,-0.8156,-1,-1,1.0

Had never tried anything steam before, but found out they've got some emulation (or something) that makes it possible to play things on a Linux box that weren't written for Linux. So I tried it, and it works great (with void Linux. Probably other distros, too). It's FANTASTIC on a desktop. Even a not very high end desktop. Currently using a Lenovo m900 tiny with an i5-6600t and 8GB ram without any problems.

Some idea for ships:
Pure battleships (no hangar needed, just turret overload)
Carriers (exact opposite of a pure battleship, maybe just a couple turrets for sentinels, a ton of hangar, and that‚Äôs it)
Some kind of repair ship for long missions
Capital Warship (maybe not bought from a shipyard, but instead built like a station)
Bombers (strong turret but limited firing angle, not as manoeuvrable as fighters)
Station ideas:
Residential stations (kinda budget trade station for non planet sectors, buys food and water and generates credits)
Heavy weapons platform (no elaboration needed)
Defensive strongholds (station with large hangar, repair, good defence and a ship shop with frigates)
Weapons ideas:
Higher tier sentinel turrets
Tier V variant for all weapons
Make the artillery actually good, or some high tier artillery, it‚Äôs in a really weird spot
Railguns/Coilguns

(this is in IP 2)

Playing in a very large sandbox, so what im guessing happened is the sandbox generated weirdly and none of the core sectors really connected, in this one lambda was consistently being very aggressive and expansionist and kept declaring war on factions that were on the other side of the map, 12-14 jumps. So they never launched any ships because the target sector was to far away... so the ships just kept building up in numbers.

Fortunately, I was in a roleplaying mood and was playing along with my neighbor faction who happened to hate lambda with its heart and soul. So it declares war and I also declare war on lambda. I send my primary fleet to wipe out lambda just for the fun of it, and what do ya know? Game lags like all hell when I enter Lambdas home sector, then immediately crashes as soon as I start attacking the enemy fleet. 

Fortunately I had a save before entering the sector so I booted that up, cloaked my fleet and dismantled my entire trade force, before re entering the sector and removing lambda from existence. Pretty sure my fleet shot down like 200 fighters and (i
I know this one for a fact) around 30 capital ships. Ooh boy the scavengers had some fun time with this. Watched a guy salvaging the cargo drops with 4 magnus class ships in tow that had been abandoned by lambda.

6508,InterstellarPilots,"""Protect"" order BUG (Interstellar Pilot 1 version 1.6.7)

Moments ago, I get a mail stating that a property of mine is being attacked. It was a Hauler-M, mining some asteroids (as you can see from the variant) with an escort Flyer-X beside it under the ""Protect"" order in Terekos sector. So that ship is being attacked by a bounty hunter using an Ares so I jumped on to the ship protecting my Hauler, turns out, it just remained cloaked like having an objection to its intended job :D

I tried checking in the order settings and I have ""attack hostiles"" and ""intercept hostiles"" on with the aggression meter set at the middle, and with the prefer cloak option turned on obviously. That Flyer-X of mine refuse to do what it's supposed to do so I did a manual human intervention and attacked the bounter hunter myself, luckily I'd succeeded. My Hauler only suffered severe shield damage, fortunately no hull damage :D

But imagine, what if your main set of ships are battling something while your mining ships get attacked and their escorts refuse to protect them. Guess, I gotta make a hard decision into letting the AI controlling my main ship that I was using, and as you know because of the bug maybe my main ship will have the same issue as well. So back to the last paragraph, I also tried troubleshooting the problem by stopping the order set on my Flyer and setting its order to protect my Hauler yet again, this time it is now fixed when another bounty hunter attacked my Hauler again (well, hopefully)

6510,InterstellarPilots,"Interstellar Pilot 1: Energy Weapons ADJUSTMENTS! (version 1.6.7)

This article will contain all\* information regarding the current adjustments made to the energy weapons in the 1.6.7 update. All energy weapons received some adjustments regarding their ""efficiency"". Hope this will help you dear pilots, especially for those who are curious regarding as to how much damage they will now have.

\*In case I missed something, additions are welcome to the comments down below, thanks.

# Lasers

Sadly, the update done to lasers is no good. All variants now have the same efficiency amount (I guess pixelfactor should change the description of Laser I then). They still have same energy costs for all variants. Though, don't get yourselves comfortable because of the lower efficiency, its damage output will be severly hindered. (I'll explain later)

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|IV|V|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|1,000 Cr|4,500 Cr|23,000 Cr|56,000 Cr|112,500 Cr|
|Energy Cost|101.2|135|202.5|295.3|421.9|
|Efficiency|0.9 (1.3)|0.9 (1.2)|0.9 (1)|0.9 (0.95)|0.9 (0.95)|
|Damage (Full Charge)|91.08 (131.56)|121.5 (162)|182.25 (202.5)|265.77 (280.535)|379.71 (400.805)|
|Charge Time (seconds)|7.5|7.5|8|9|9|
|Range|250|300|300|375|550|

# Plasma Pulse

Good news, pixelfactor finally paid attention to this sluggish yet lethal weapon (high risk, high reward). All variants got an increased efficiency, while still keeping the same energy cost.

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|2,750 Cr|9,000|29,000|
|Energy Cost|253.1|337.5|421.9|
|Efficiency|1.1 (1)|1.1 (1)|1.1 (1)|
|Damage|278.41 (253.1)|371.25 (337.5)|464.09 (421.9)|
|Charge Time (seconds)|12|13.5|15|
|Range|300|350|475|
|Speed|150|125|100|

# Photon Burst

Last but not least, the photon burst also received some adjustments regarding its efficiency. Fortunately, it also relates to the Plasma Pulse in terms of the said adjustments.

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|3,500 Cr|7,200 Cr|21,250 Cr|
|Energy Cost|135|236.2|354.4|
|Efficiency|1.1 (1)|1.1 (1)|1.1 (1)|
|Damage|148.5 (135)|259.82 (236.2)|389.84 (354.4)|
|Charge Time (seconds)|6|9|12|
|Range|350|425|450|
|Speed|225|225|225|

# Finding the actual damage of the weapons

Actually, the game does not provide a clear statement as to what the damage of your weapon is supposed to be. Luckily, efficiency is provided alongside the energy cost. To do this, assuming the efficiency is RELATED to the ""energy cost-damage ratio"" of the weapon, just MULTIPLY the energy cost with efficiency and you will get the weapon's damage.

**REMEMBER: Less efficiency means more amount for the ""energy cost"" compared to the ""damage"" of a weapon, hence the nerf of the laser's efficiency significantly hindered its damage output as you can see from the stats above. While more efficiency means more amount for the ""damage"" compared to the ""energy cost"" of the said weapon such as of the Plasma Pulse and Photon Burst.**

For example, a laser II's energy cost is 135 units, with an efficiency of 0.9, applying the formula for ""finding the actual damage of the weapons"", this means that it has a damage of 121.5 units in the current version. As for the prior version, it has an efficiency of 1.2, meaning it should deal 162 units of damage in its weaponry.

Another is for the Photon Burst I, it has an energy cost of 135 units as well, though with an efficiency of 1.1. Applying the formula as to how to solve for the damage of the weapon, we get 148.5 units worth of damage. In the prior version, with an efficiency of exactly ""1"", we get the same damage as with its energy cost which is 135 units, lol.

So logically, THE FIRST LEVEL of the Photon Burst is better than THE SECOND LEVEL of the Laser in regards to those examples. I hope you learned something, and thank you for reading! Have a great day pilot :D",2022-11-14 08:36:56,8,0,0.9598,1,1,1.0

P.S. I know I might sound stupid, but I'm challenging myself to only use small ships in the game, no frigates, and definitely no capital ships 'cause I'm poor :D

Also, my faction is just 3 real life days old. Aptly named; ""Renzorps Inc.""

And yes, this is Interstellar Pilot 1.

ANYWAY, MY ARMY CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:
> Main Army
- 8 Flyer A (that includes me since I lead the group, no fleets assigned)

> Interceptors (decoys)
- 18 Raptor A (6 per fleet, all laser turrets)

> Reinforcement
- 6 Flyer X (just in case, all in one fleet)

HOW I USE IT
- I use my main army as sort of a patrol group to look out for any baddies lurking with in and out of my sector, especially I watch out for any distress calls.
- When raiding a station, I start out by making my ""interceptors"" go in as the frontline to see if there's enemy ships guarding that station, they could also inflict some primary damage since usually they outnumber my enemies. Unsurprisingly, some of them die in the process which is fine, because I could always buy some replacement provided I have economy income in the game. Seldomly, all of my ""interceptors"" could also get wiped out.
- Next, if the plan is successful, no wiping out happens, I would engage with my main group together with my ship and proceed to massacre their station to oblivion.
- As for my backups, they are just there to reinforce my group just in case my raptors get wiped out, and we are forced to fight since we are in the middle of the battlefield, enemy missiles locked on to everyone, I would order them to come as a last resort to kill my enemies. On the same occasion as my raptors are wiped out, one of my group died down since we are forced to stay in the fight for the enemies are locking down on us, F.",2022-10-09 13:01:20,10,0,-0.9962,-1,-1,1.0

6609,InterstellarPilots,"Finally updates after all these years!!

II've had some ideas over the years, and i literally can't supress my excitement that this game is getting updates again. These ideas of mine were

Station upgrades
Weapon upgrades (stats boost to existing weapons aside from just changing the weapon altogether)
Alien factions (invaders sort of)
Create ""custom role"" (more like preset instructions macro shortcut""

I just found this reddit sub so these ideas are probably suggested already, but here goes. 

Right now as you go on you end up building more and more stations, and at some point it just ends up as either a cluster that ships get stuck in or you're stuck having to place defenses on multiple clusters, this adding even more clutter, or build stations waaaaayy too far from each other. 

Station upgrades will probably solve this problem, with levels 1-5
Assuming a station that costs 1M credits
Lvl1 is base station

Lvl2 has 2x  Production (+ some stats upgrade but not 2x HP and shield for ""balance"" ) and costs (base price+ 10%) to upgrade, hence 1.1M

Lvl 3 has 3x production and some stat bonuses, for upgrade cost of 1.21M.

Lvl4 at 4x P, for upgrade cost of 1.331M

Lvl5 at 5x P, costing 1.4641M to upgrade.

Upgrade cost is +10% of preceeding level

Costs will probably be adjusted for balance, this just gives an idea.

As for balance and logic, it will probably be better to get at most lvl2 stations for the early game, only upgrading to higher levels later. Partly because it will cost more and partly because the station hp and shield doesn't scale the same as the production and capacity increase, so you need to have dedicated defense (which costs some more) lest you loose a lot for a single station. Also maybe make npcs more aggressive towards higher level stations

Another idea i have is the ""create custom role"", where you can save presets that contains orders, and behaviors, say ""trader passive"", agression at zero, aleays cloak, never engage and trade. Its a minor convenience, but over time it will add up to a lot especially when the credits go flooding in. 

As for alien faction, maybe make it so that they ""cross over"" to our galaxy using the unstable wormholes in the game, appearing at random sectors, with varying fleet strength everytime, say sometimes just recon forces, sometimes full on invasion fleet. Or two or more factions so some are friendly, some are not. 

Make it so that the aliens have ""special equipment"" that sometimes gets dropped when they are killed. Also you can use the unstable wormhole that the aliens came from to jump onto their sector. You can get trapped there tho, and can only bring 1 ship (along with docked ships)",2022-09-27 08:57:28,15,0,0.9375,1,1,1.0

After the arms race, TEF and Lambda were dumbfounded.   CLL Systems and ADR had backstabbed them into making them believe there was a war, only to steal credits right from under their noses.  They both felt betrayed, betrayed at everyone.

And so, they found comfort backstabbing others.

TEF had turned into a massive imperialist nightmare.  They used their brand new toys poking and prodding and small, independent factions.  They would regularly kidnap pilots that spoke out against their practices.  TEF believed, fanatically, it was their right to rule the entire universe.  Luckily, they never put this into action, but they had an absolute hatred of any other galactic power during their delusions.

Lambda became greedy beyond belief.   They would bribe and extort civillians to close off trade routes, so they and *only* them could access any goods.  Lambda would gouge prices to unbelievable heights, and when they rose the price of food rations to a factor of 4, the poor civillian workers died off in the thousands.  They attempted to make war against the ITP so they and *only* they controlled the trade.

For hundreds of years, the dark ages of the Uncharted Space ensued, and the universe became unlivable, just like the Sol System.   Whatever asteroids floated by were quickly mined, and then confiscated by Lambda or TEF.

*And so, like their ancestors, they looked out for answers.*

They detected a new wormhole a few units away from Beta Pindola.  This was their only hope at continuing humanity, but above all continuing their birth-right powertrip and an obsession with credits and trade.  They knew, like those first scientists, *there must be something on the other side.*

TEF, only fueled by the dream of expansion, and Lambda, only brought forth by the lure of vast riches, took the leap.

6732,InterstellarPilots,"VOL. 5 | THE ARMS RACE

The massive economic boom brought forth by the ITP called for the creation of newer, stronger ships to protect these vital trade routes.  Lambda, incredibly reliant on trade, developed a new solution to this problem, : **The Hornet.** The hornet was as quick as lightning,  and was cheap to produce.  An instant hit, it was used by criminals, cops, and citizens alike.   The X-Variant was developed by ADR Technologies, who were known for their civilian models and their experimentation with cloaks and radar jammers. 

TEF snapped back quickly with their personally developed, militarized **Flyer.**  Slower but stronger, it could easily disarm most ships in the universe.  It was co-produced by CLL Systems under their propaganda of Lambda hostilities.  Lambda made tTeheir own copies under ADR. 

Lambda was also working on a secret project, **The Magnus**. Although powerful, it was not a primary combat ship, but rather a mobile base and projection of force.  However, a bandit raid under the command of Keno Duerr stole a prototype and returned it to Black Sail.  Even after this, the Magnus began small scale production. 

TEF, after receiving news of this threat, (And propaganda from ADR), began work on the **Overlord** and **Ares.**  Incredibly powerful and highly useful, these were a mainstay of TEF for a long period of time.  

Lambda, with an even bigger need for trade, developed the **Orion** and **Creon**.  Designed for large scale trade across long distances, they were vital for the sustenance of Lambda's thirst for even more goods. 

TEF, rising to the occasion again, quietly began work on a new ship, **The Thunder**. Acting as both a frigate and interceptor, it could be used for both trade and conquest, and competed quite nicely against the Orion and Creon. 

This deathless war would continue for quite a while as both developed increasingly advanced military equipment.",2021-10-25 23:22:41,14,0,0.9075,1,1,1.0

# ECONOMIC BOOM

After the horrific ordeals of the war,  Rebel Collective grew to be scared of outside contact and instated a period of severe xenophobia.  They shut themselves off from the rest of the world yet struggled to build a self sufficient system, forcing them to go back to raiding refineries and shipyards for the very little scraps they could get their hands on.  They were just as powerful, yet were failing to grow at all, causing mass migrations toward neutral independent factions, which eventually spit up the Rebel Collective into a loose group of bitter trade partners.  The Rebel Collective owned a trade station in Rebel-controlled Terekos (known as the Laharan Republic), however that was destroyed in a testing range accident. 

The mining and trading sectors benefitted for the sudden demand, and experiences experienced an economic boom like nothing else.  NewHaven, DSMC, New World Mining, and Bluestar created the Intergalactic Trade Pact, which controlled 60% of all trade through various sectors.  New ships such as the Venture, Pioneer, and Hauler greatly contributed to the average miner and merchant's life. 

On the shadier side of things, Al-Ghat was mass producing Impulse, a recreational and military drug made to enhance worker performance and the mental acuity of Fighter Pilots.  A cheap, easy to get commodity, it caused several legal problems and was outlawed by the TEF.  Due to Al-Ghat's ties to the professional smugglers in Dymapa 753, and the dwindling supply of Galene materials to use,  they were able to produce it in the hands of smugglers with homegrown Dymapa-753 materials.  However, when most of the Impulse was siezed by TEF enforcers, these outlaws fiercely protected and hid their dwindling supply of the drug.",2021-10-25 22:45:27,12,0,-0.9756,-1,-1,1.0

# The Time of Dying

After conquering Solace and Dymapa 753, bandits rose to biblical levels of power and wealth.  They managed to do this while generally avoiding contact with the TEF, with the exception of the Pindolan War.  Most bandits were refugees from the Sol System facing political persecution, or financially destitute indentured workers from Orbital Farms and Refineries.  They generally were able to escape TEF rule by flying TEF ships in disguise into unchartered sectors and then being hauled off to rebel processing stations.

The Terran Expeditionary Force imposed trade embargoes towards factions  towards Black Sail, local bandit factions, and the Fortuna Rebels, from now known as the Rebel Coalition.   These underdeveloped territories formed into a loose conglomerate of rebel dissenters known as the Fortuna Rebels.  These rebels, along with the bandits, launched a massive surprise attack known as the Shipyard Massacre.  The rebel groups bombed the large shipyards in Gatopea wile Fortuna Rebels boarded and ransacked the stations.  The TEF, with the help of Lambda, responded to these attacks with a massive offensive into Dymapa 753.  This offensive failed, but with horrifying losses on both sides.

The Lambdan Navy lured the Rebel Coalition out of Solace and Dymapa 753.   The ensuing conflict was by far the largest military engagement in the entire universe, with millions of ships on both sides and spanning 5 sectors. The Lambdan Navy held out for just long enough for TEF to meet the battle in the outskirts of Galene and Hellemus, where the most intense fighting occurred. The battle lasted for 5 days in a series of grueling dogfights and ship boardings.  In the end, though, the rebels were the first to dip out of the battle.  As before, appalling casualties on both sides were not replenished for years.  The entire economy of the interstellar universe was in ruins.

*Historians estimate that about 1,771,700 ships were destroyed that day.  The total human death toll numbered approximately 3,000,000.  The average age was 21 years old.*",2021-10-23 18:42:50,16,0,-0.9949,-1,-1,1.0

# The Expansion Period

&#x200B;

Early on, all of the Sol System used Gatopea as an interstellar playground.  There was no limits, no laws, and a wild abundance of incredibly rare materials back on Earth.  At this time in history, this sector was originally an asteroid field, but that was quickly over-mined.   Some small expedition crews were sent to its flagship planet, where raw materials could be easily collected.

Expansion to other sectors became easy.  Androla and Hellemus became the go-to hub for mining and raw resources.  Terekos was the breadbasket of the new frontier.   They discovered a new planetary sector, Galene, which served as a trading post for exotic goods.  Expansion to Beta Pindola was difficult, as primitive bandit factions united to defend the area.  TEF captured them in a massive battle during the Great Pindolan War. Beta Pindola was the secondary major hub of the frontier.

Two new ships were created:  The Shuttle and the Raptor.  The Shuttle immediately outclassed the Ranger as the primary spacecraft, as it was both economical, and can be used for almost everything.  The Raptor was similar to the Shuttle and Ranger but was build with scouting and light combat in mind.

A number of factions were set up, including Lambda Corp, which originally specialized in cross-sector freight.   Al-Ghat was an exotic materials and weapons dealer that settled in Galene.  Nobody really liked them, but they were needed to keep TEF stocked with their navy.

The group of primitive bandits and runaway outlaws united under Black Sail, but were still divided into their own territories.   They generally avoided contact with anyone else, and set up bases in the previously undiscovered Dymapa 753.

After OPERATION CASBAH by Lambda, Solace was discovered, but was almost immediately overrun by bandits.  Solace was used by the bandits to produce arms and equipment, as well as the rallying point of the capitol ships.",2021-10-23 15:54:23,15,0,0.8854,1,1,1.0

***I am making a history of the Interstellar Pilot Universe.  This is volume one. Tell me what you think.***

# 

In 2230, a group of astronauts were manning a small orbital station, circling around Titan.  This station was a joint project conducted between the United American Federation (Modern USA), and the North African Republic (Modern Egypt).  On routine maintenance calls, they spotted a faint, strange object a few miles away.

&#x200B;

*It glowed a bright green.*

&#x200B;

Scientists had not seen anything like this before, although they knew fairly well that it was a wormhole.  The very thought of this shook civilization to its core.  They knew they had to test it, but were not ready to do it on humans.  They designed a few simple drones that would get in and get out of the wormhole.  These missions were a success, but they returned with high levels of radiation and with odd new chemicals attached to them.

They decided to build a craft with humans inside of it.  For 3 years, they used the best available technologies and every government in the Sol System were cooperating on a common goal.  The day came, and the 2 brave astronauts stepped inside the Vulcan-1.

The leap into the wormhole was only described by the pilots as a green tunnel obscuring your entire vision.  It was eerie and mind numbing.  But, according to them, it was worth it.  They ventured into a whole new galaxy, barraged with a onslaught of new experiences around them, all from the saftey of their own little ship.

&#x200B;

*They didn't see the meteor coming.*

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the radio signals did not make it in time, but the temperature and ionizers shifted dramatically.  They knew there was something on the other side.  These scientists, dedicated to their craft and their respective nations, worked hard to make this new hope possible.

The Vulcan-2 managed to return successfully.  They were anointed as heroes to mankind, and given millions of credits.  Most importantly, they set a basis of knowledge to allow more ships to venture in.

Eventually, a commercial model of the Vulcan-2 was made, now known as the Ranger-A.  Cheap to make and easy to operate, everyone in the Sol System used them.

Over the next few decades, a number of small colonies were made by different nations.  They united themselves under one common name:

***The Terran Expeditionary Force.***

Sure, the game is pretty basic and simple, just a space adventure/light action mobile game.  But the way it goes about doing it is so well done.  It's a shame it was abandoned, this game is truly amazing. 

Each sector just has a different mood.  Gatopea has a big boom, industrial feel, and places like Solace or Hellemus have the feeling of isolated, gloomy bastions. 

You have the feeling you are the captian of your own humble ship.  The world is huge, and you genuinely feel like you are making progress as you gain power, wealth, and make alliances. 

The ships are detailed for such a simple game and it forces you to use your credits wisely on specific upgrades. The combat requires timing and the correct craft.  The economy feels alive and everything depends on one another.

However, it's also the small details. You can communicate to AI as you travel about the galaxy. You can scavenge recent battle sites and sell the scraps at a refinery.  You can group up ships and send them off to run errands for you.

I've played interstellar pilot for quite a while. However one thing that always irked me was the Black sail outpost: It always maxes out it's cargo space on junk. It'll be filled with missiles and mines picked up by scavengers, then once it reaches it's limit, the scavengers sit in it's hangar bay indefinitely. This wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that it acts as a refinery, meaning once it's filled up, my miners go and wait there as well, inside or outside. I would really like to see an extremely powerful black sail faction, and using it's refineries to fund the bandit faction. (As well as fortuna but that's different.

The only solution I've ever come up with is destroying the outpost. It's not all that risky if you don't have infrastructure yet in Dymapa, but it's infuriating I have to go out of my way to solve the problem.

So after ""acquiring""(stealing) Magnuses from npc factionand and selling them, I looked around for a pirate stations to exterminate.I found an isolated station with three laser III and one laser V turrets.
After some scouting with a cloaked hornet, I found out four fighters that, after decloacking, bait them into the rest of my fleet: a magnus-a, two flyer-a and two thunder-a. Happy with the situation, I got back at the helm of my magnus, and this is where think start going bad. My hornet-x is destroyed in the opening salvo of the battle, surprised and concerned I take a look at the sector map and there is not four, not five nor seven... but a dozen fighters.

I immediately start firing my guns at them but after missiles and mines exploding all around me, my shield take some damages, but are still holding. The same happens to my fighters but some of their shields are nearly downs and one of the thunder got some hull damages. Trying to resolve the shields problem I start salvaging the battlefield, waiting for my shield to recharge, but the pirate weren't done yet they started sending small waves of fighter, not enough to do real damage but enough to make my shield recharge impossible.

And then I make my second error, I trusted the autopilot which following is programming started not to head back to my base but decided to engage the turrets... at very close range. Before I can react, one of the three laser III turrets is dead, grabbing the opportunity is redirected the shots towards the laser V turret and started throwing everything I had. Salvo after salvo of laser and rockets bring the turret down and started heading back to my base myself, but not before another wave of fighter got send my way. Those fighter broke my shield and begins firing directly into the hull.

In Interstellar Pilot the prices of weapons do not scale linearly with their effectiveness, a weapon like a laser V, while \~5x more powerful than a laser I, is 100x more expensive. the same goes for shields and engines. this means that the cheaper option is usually better. for a fleet, you may want to buy a ton of fighters or a few capital ships. both of these options have serious flaws, in that even maxed fighters are cannon fodder, with only a max of 300 shields, and capital ships cost too much for their quite low shielding.  


 Frigates are the clear answer. with a max shielding of 600 (150 Shield points more than an Ares) and the ability to hold effective weapons like the Photon burst 2, these ships are amazing bang for buck, but you may have already known this. but which frigate is the best for a fleet? is it the Orion class?, or the supremely powerful thunder?, no.   


The humble Venture class frigate is the best combat ship, costing under 50k for the unarmed version the ship really does not have much going for itself. until when you realize that fully upgraded it's more powerful than a Ares. for a similar price. only around \~200k for upgrades, it'll become a maxed fighting unit that can beat an Ares! you could put 2 laser V turrets on your magnus for the same price and sure they may do slightly more damage, but those laser Vs aren't independently operating space craft. just 6 of these ships will destroy a magnus in 1 - 2 barages. that's only 1,200,000 for ships that can destroy MANY magnus' ain't that impressive?

6761,InterstellarPilots,"How to steal a Capital ship !!

I don't know if you guys already know about this or not, but here we go, you can steal a Capital ship(namely the Magnus and the Overlord)

First: max out your relationship with the faction who owns the ship, or enough so they allow you to dock in their Capital ships(preferably capital ships actively trading )

2nd: dock in their Capital ship after checking it's orders,  if it's trading or going back to base or repairing,  dock quickly before the capital ship docks in a station, then immediately undock from your own ship while inside the Capital ship, but stay in the capital ship, wait for it to dock in a station.

3rd: once the capital ship leaves the station on its own, it becomes yours, just like that, but make sure to cancel its current orders, and immediately change the ship's name(very important) and assign it to a fleet and give it orders to dock in your station or anywhere else, best if you sell it, you'll make around 980k-1.1M credits, and even better if you have a mission to deliver that very ship.

Hope it helps, I already make millions even before I even own any Station or turret,  Also best used in a custom universe, since they trade with Magnus class battleships for some reason.",2021-03-16 03:14:06,14,0,0.9866,1,1,1.0

6765,InterstellarPilots,"The Economic System

So, over the past month, ive been getting back into Interstellar Pilot. Nowadays, Im noticing more and more mechanics, and in game problems ive never noticed before. Below is what ive noticed about the Economic System, and the role bandits play in it.


So, i was flying through a system I had just cleared of bandits. The bandits were a mighty force to be reckoned with, and it was a hard fight, with alot of casualties for both sides. Before I cleared them out the system was buzzing with activity and trade, and had lots of Equipment Dealers patrolling around. Then, once I cleared out the bandits, it seemed to almost kill the economy in the system. All of the Equipment Dealers just up and left, as well as alot of the trade. In several systems, the factions who were based there began building stations of the same type they already had there, which ultimately killed the economy there fully. This got me thinking about the correlation between bandit presence, and trade.

After some digging, I began to realize just what role bandits played. Apparently, according to my findings in several saves, (and nearly causing the economy to die in all of them), every time that I killed a bandit group, the system in which they were located, was thrown off balance, and the economy crashed due to prices for goods going to high, and every time this happened, the faction up and left the system, for more favorable locations. The Bandits also bring a new sort of economy into play: the Ship economy. With Bandit presence in a system, it also brings Patrollers, Enforcers, and Bounty Hunters too. Factions that use these kinds of roles often have to buy new ships, and usually, in bandit systems, theres a military outpost placed there, to fuel the presence of these enforcer types of factions.

In the end of my digging, I realized that bandits are one of the sole reasons that systems have so much activity, whether it be trading, mining, or patrollers. Now, people may be wondering, ""If this is true, how do we prevent bandits from killing ships?"" This is quite simple.. you dont. Because of the bandit attacks, it brings in more patrollers. More patrollers means a military outpost, and maybe a repair shop are placed. More patrollers means more security, meaning more merchant ships come. The more merchant ships that come, the more stations that are placed. The more stations placed, the more bandit sttacks increase in size and intensity. Its all one big cycle, and, if you break part of it, the rest of it collapses.

6779,InterstellarPilots,"Mining Issues

Hey guys,

I have been playing in Universe 2, a wormhole too far, and I have amassed about 5 million credits. My main base of operations is at Beta Pindola, and I have established all the stations except for the refinery and the orbital farm. Now here comes the issue. There is a severe lack of nanochips. All the refineries in the universe have no nanochips in their cargo bay. This would mean that any product that requires nanochips cannot be produced (medipacks, hoverbikes, hypersleep pods and plasma rifles). This causes all trade to grind to a halt. So I was thinking, it could be because there was a lack of copper ore. However, all mining ships, including my own, are filled with ore, but cannot find a place to sell them. This may be a possible glitch, because I can manually sell the ore at any refinery, but on autopilot, the ships just cannot seem to be able to sell them. I was hoping you guys have an answer to this. Thanks!

On top of that, no matter how much hover bike stock I build up, my vehicle factory always stays the most expensive option to buy from. Even the TEF one with absolutely no supply appears to be preferred over my factory.

6807,InterstellarPilots,"I sent Pixelfactor an email back in 2018 when I started playing. Fast forward to 2020 and I found out they're not updating anymore, which is sad. Down below is said email with some alterations. I still play this game BTW. Man I wish they came back.

Greetings, I am a new player that discovered this game a few weeks ago. It is fun, and as I'm going around blasting bandits I thought of some things that should improve the game.

Well, here are my suggestions:
1. Fleets. Able to create infinite numbers of fleets (and perhaps naming the fleet) consisting of any amount of ships.

2. Orders.
A. Resupply (auto or not): Have your ships resupply ammo, countermeasures, mines, etc. It works by setting a resupply base for the said ship along with the desired amount of the selected cargo to be resupplied on the particular ship. Example: An Orion gunboat with missile launchers all over, with a Magnus as a supply depot. When ordered to resupply, it will automatically dock at the Magnus and take the amount of the previously set cargo, let's say 25 Interceptors.
B. Auto resupply for stations. Works similary like the 'Resupply' order but in reverse. Example: A Brewery with a ship assigned to supply it with food grains. Once it ran out of said cargo (but still has cargo space available) the ship assigned to resupply it will buy the required resource.
I think it's best for this order to come with a ratio selector for stations that uses more than one commodity to produce another. Example: X_nanochips + X_alloys = X_plasma rifle. The supply ship will only supply the station according to the desired ratio. Meaning, if the station has 10a and 13b and it has a manufacture ratio of 2a : 3b = 5c, the supplying ship will only add 2b even though it has more, which will increase the station's inventory to 10a and 15b, thus conforming to said ratio. To make it less complicated, set the supply ships to resupply after the station has exhausted all its resources.
C. Upgrade. Order a ship to upgrade its components to a specific setting. You don't really need it if you only have one ship. But if you own 10 Haulers and want to buy equip a cloak for each one of them and you have to do it one by one, it gets tiresome and inconvenient.

3. Improved fleet settings. I have a Magnus and 3 Thunders docked in. They're set to 'prefer cloak' but when I order them to attack something, they just roam around near the target without doing anything, same with 'prefer dock' turned on.

4. Building mode. You can place stations at a specific location in the sector you are in. It makes your stations tidy, (I like to keep things tidy) especially when setting up laser perimeters. You can also move around already built stations in that sector.

5. Select ship. Select all, or some of your ships to execute an orde and alter fleet settings, including those in my suggestion. Example: You have 15 Orions and you want to turn them into gunboats, so you select all 15 and order them to 'upgrade' (swap, really) their turrets to have military launchers. Doing it one by one will be inconvenient. Example 2: You have 15 Haulers and you order them to trade while also turning off 'intercept hostiles' option in their fleet settings while also turning on 'prefer cloak' option.

6. Hauler M fix. The second mining turret won't work when the Hauler M is ordered to mine.

Well, this is what came up in my mind while playing. I hope it could be implemented to the game and create a positive impact to all other players. Thank for you creating such a great game. I've rated the game 5 star on Google Play, BTW. I hope it helps.",2020-07-11 03:58:54,15,0,0.9946,1,1,1.0

Hi guys, 

I have a couple of questions regarding stations. 

Firstly, how do my stations obtain supplies? My guess is that other NPC traders come to my stations and sell the required materials to my station for production.

Secondly, I have noticed that there are insufficient NPCs who come to my stations to supply them with goods to produce, fewer than those who come to my station to buy the product (eg. not enough food grains to produce pindolan ale). As such, I want to build my own orbital farms etc to supply my own stations. When the, say for example, grains are ready, do they automatically transfer to the brewery for production, or do I have to do it manually?

Thirdly, if I have to transfer manually, is it possible to transfer it using autopilot?

Fourthly, how can I ensure that I have a continuous supply of the required goods, because I am losing a lot of buyers?

I mean I could just keep transferring the cargo but that would be tedious I have many stations.

Yes my tactic is a bit of exotic but it works all the time.

1. Start with a Hornet. Do some trading or jobs so you can hire a little fleet of other small ships. Then raid merchants.üòä

2. With the Money you get buy a little Hornet fleet. With them you can raid more and and more for more profit. If you want more support buy some Shuttles and start your own Cup Company. I works pretty good

3. With a small raiding fleet and a small economy fleet you can star to militarise your faction. I buy usually 2 or 3 Overlords.
My tactic to conquer a system(Dymapa 753) is rush the enemy with Hornets and destroy them with long range artillery support from my Overlords. It works pretty good.

Wouldve been nice if they make a class that has no shields but the hull integrity is really high, especially the front.

Good against stations and battlecruisers. This is one of those ships that are not really necessary but can be beneficial.

What seems to be happening is they just remain in a cloaked state and let the enemy pound away on the Magnus shielding with impunity as if they were zero aggressive and were set to not attack anything at all.  My thought is the cloaks are keeping them from doing more than silently ghost along.

&#x200B;

Is there a way to fix this misbehaviour short of selling all those cloaking devices I purchased for the escort wing?

Just started my own budding refinery in Androla with an asteroid ring next to Gatopea wormhole. I currently have a fleet of 8 Hauler Ms and 3 have been assigned to my Androla refinery. The refinery and the asteroids are surrounded by a ring of 8 Laser Vs with overlapping cover

A lot of bandits and bounty hunters have been traversing that sector lately and have been attempting to pick off my Haulers esp the ones that seem to stray off to the edge.

I am also planning to expand my refinery empire in the more riskier Hellemus with my other Haulers since that is the only sector with Ice asteroids. However, 3 hostile factions have set up shipyards abt 20k away and there are frequent attacks by hostile Overlords.

TL;DR: I wanted to know a way to set my Haulers to auto-mine while cloaked or if there's a way I can make use of the cloaked function for the Hauler Ms to cloak when being attacked while uncloaking to mine

This will be my opinion on changes in 1.6.0 that I already know.

1. Mining Laser
   You can't buy Mining Laser and Adv. Mining Laser anymore (or they just changed the buying shop, it was on Refinery before). This is bad for me. Hauler-H miner is actually really good.

2. Interface Layout
   The cargo trade and equipment screen is much neater and easier to navigate. Pretty good especially if you have something specific to buy and don't want to waste time pressing arrow buttons to look at every cargo.

3. Mercenary AI
   A nice addition, helps for station attacks. Pretty cheap too. Only if there were more of them.

4. Autopilot Orders
   The ""Repair to Nearest"" order is a nice touch. It saves time. Maybe next update dev should add Scavenge, Patrol and Explore commands.

5. Friend Bar Glitch
   This is a glitch (I think it isn't meant to be added) that I found where the Friendliness meter exceeds the maximum. This actually is a big help, since they give REALLY GOOD prices.

--> Cloaking device on AI controlled Capital ship used for combat is a big NO NO NO.

I have an Overlord with a full compliment of Orion-X frigates with 2 Ares-X escorts as my main combat fleet. After several rounds of fighting missions i noticed that my Ares's hull are frequently damaged. I found the culprit to be the Cloaking Device because these Ares would always want to cloak during the thick of the battle. I then disabled its preference to cloak but the cloaking still happens during battle. So I then manually disabled the component itself but as soon as I issued an order the cloaking device is magically enabled again.. I think this is a bug

Nothing is wrong with my Orions because they can appear/disappear in just 1.2 sec (using the best cloaking device available for them) but the Ares and my Overlord takes 5 sec to do the same. During this period the ship drops shield and it very vulnerable to enemy fire.

I suggest that you make a ship that lives of shields and has low armor and add shield piercing woepons to counteract them buff the fighters and make a new class for fighters interceptors that can go extremely fast but can only carry light weopons like lasers and have a advanced AI A dreadnaught class wich would be way more powerfull than anything we have seen 12 hangar bays whit huge amounts of woepons like 16 woepons a new railgun woepon wich could pierce multiple targets or be the shield bypassing weopon A corrosion cannon wich deals damage to armor over time but deals 50% lower damage to shields and uses ammo A laser weopon that bounces over other targets EMP cannons wich take away power supply and do more damage agaisnt shields. Equipable armors that would protect electronics from EMP woepons maybe Corrosion ressistant armor wich lowers the effect of corrosion cannons and maybe armor wich absorbs energy from laser woepons and add it to your capacitator buff the plasma weopons a bit theyre underpowered as a repeating issue that everyone uses nothing but lasers its kinda dull and boring and i want to see more variety wich means different weopons ships equipment in fleets and everything wich would make multyplayer if it would ever come even more entertaining as you have so much to choose from. Also i have more on a bigger set of commodoties make like gatopean gas that you can mine out of the planet wich would make mining also more interesting add starts where you can extract helium and hydrogen from them. To fix the issue of long times of travelling make a cruise drive wich would speed you up to 300 speed but drop your shields and impair your weopons kinda like cloak.

Some ideas!

‚Ä¢ New weapons, notably for smaller ships, as they tend to get outgunned easily even against their equals if energy isn't managed right.

‚Ä¢ Energy focus! Being able to redirect energy flow into certain components, mostly shield directions, engines, and weapons.

‚Ä¢ Adding the Comms system from Scenarios into Universe, to help make the game more alive. This could also lead to hiring wingmen, as seen in the first scenario, or even bargaining with enemies to keep them from blowing your ship to dust.

‚Ä¢ 'Magnus-F' flagship class, housing 10 docking bays of Frigate or below, has 'small' weaponry purchasable inside (Frigate and below), and has Repair Facilities. To balance things out, it could lack shields, instead having a 10 second 'Flagship' cloaking device, prompting a more defensive usage.

6963,InterstellarPilots,"IP Review

Hi!  :) I'm just giving a review, mostly for the purposes of the designer ;)


IP  is probably one of the best mobile platform space trader Sims out there. Having played things like space traders, into the void, and alite, this game stands on top as the most seamless and immersing experience in my eyes. The game is also well priced, with a small purchase needed to unlock late game ships. The graphics can stand on the same ground as something like Harbinger. However, this game has some deep, between the cracks flaws which keep it from realizing it's full potential. 

It's been a long time since any game has sucked me into the game play and made me feel like I'm there. A lot of my game buying experience is a desperate search for immersion and this game delivers. Traveling from one end of a universe to the other feels like a trek (especially with full fleets), you gain a real sense of accomplishment as you go from a single ship to 8 full fleets, and the universe you're put in will progress with you so that every day in game is a new day. The graphics can be down right beautiful at times; I had a sector filled with ice comets and an earth like planet which took my breath away. That sector is my home sector :)

Since this review is mostly for the developer, it will be more heavy on the criticisms since I'll be going into more detail. Please don't get me wrong, this game is a 4/5 for me at the moment and so tantalizingly close to 5 stars. 

First, let's talk about controls. The first suggestion I'll make before any other is every window needs a close box/X. It's pretty annoying to have to press back 4 times and then undock after searching for prices through the trader at an outpost. This situation of having to press back many times pops up pretty often and simply adding a close window option to the log window and others would be a massive quality of life improvement. It would also be nice if the camera could remember the distance you set it to instead of always defaulting to somewhere far. While we're talking about the camera, a free look function would also be awesome to have; I've been resorting to locking my camera and targeting outpost around a sector to get a good look. 

Also in line with controls is the actual act of trading. It can get tedious when you have to constantly switch ships or cargo to fill a fleet with goods or sell your goods. I think it should be possible to buy goods in one ship in a fleet and have any excess goods overflow into the other ships in the fleet and vice versa for selling, especially with the buy/sell as many as possible buttons in the trading interface. Another nice addition would be the ability to select systems in the galaxy map, see a list of stations, and be able to scan those stations.  This would be a massive quality of life improvement. 

In terms of graphics, I think adding life bars above the targeting reticles would be awesome. It can be tough to keep track of which ships need to be pulled out of a fight to keep them from being destroyed. 

Now let's talk game play. I have a lot to say here. 

Firstly, diplomacy and faction competition is really bare bones at the moment. Sure, there are individual factions, but the alliance lines are very cut and dry; there are good guys and bad guys and that's about it. You attack one good guy (even though the game says they have no allies) and you lose favoring with all good factions, which is most factions unfortunately.  It was pretty disappointing to find out I couldn't start a war with a competing faction because I'd become an enemy of every faction in their moral alignment. 

So why would I want to start a war? This game has a disappointing lack of conflict. Yes, you can have bounties on your head which will cause bounty hunters to chase you, and you might get the stray bandit capital ship raiding other ships, but by enlarge the bandits just have their assess handed to them. I've yet to see bandits take over whole systems or launch fleet sized raids. Just war in general hasn't  popped  up in this game, yet this game has all the elements for war. This game even has all the elements for trade war, but the pricing engine doesn't create a very diverse economy. You'll have a few systems offering different prices, but for the most part most stations offer the same prices, and even when there is variation it doesn't ever feel meaningful. Thankfully, where the stations are positioned and the quantity of goods they have does create meaningful diversity, but the pricing does need attention. This game is sort of in a state where you feel way too free yet constricted at the same time.

Here's my suggestions:
-moral alignment needs to go away and be replaced with more explicit alliances. As long as it's not just everybody who is honorable is now an ally, this will diversify and give more meaning to diplomacy. Instead of just asking yourself if you want to be evil, crooked, or honorable, you can ask do you want to be with the merchant clan, or the war clan, or the intellectual clan, for example. This can be accomplished by having factions that build outposts that support each other be allies (like if a refinery and small arms factory are in the same sector) and enemies if they compete (two refineries in the same sector). Trade could also increase alliance between npc factions. I think a bandit faction is still a good idea
-diplomacy also needs more depth. You're either at war with a faction or they don't care about you. Actual alliance or positive moral favor doesn't really bring any meaningful rewards besides not being at war with that faction. I think something like lowered or raised prices would be a good start. 
-bandits, especially during the late game, need to be more threatening. They need to start trying to take over whole systems and actually succeed in some cases. I want to see my trade routes disrupted and my authority in a sector challenged. 
-diplomatic relationships should decay, and what improves your standing with a faction should be limited so you can't be friends with ALL the good or bad guys, and they should be able to deteriorate to war, especially with crooked factions. Simply trading with one faction or doing their missions shouldn't give you favor with every faction of that moral alignment in my opinion
-I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation, but I'd like 50+sector universes



If you can't tell, I think this game holds the most potential in diplomacy. I think with just a few adjustments this game could really be a 5 star experience. 


As a side note, I went to the Missouri University of Science and Technology for computer science. I don't know if the designer will see this but:

6968,InterstellarPilots,"Luxury Resources not Decaying in Custom Universe

In the preset universes the top tier resources (jewellery, hoverbikes, medkits etc) slowly disappear from the trade station. This is essential because stations have finite storage and nobody can buy top tier resources once they are sold to a trade station. This slow decay doesn't appear to occur when you play custom.

This results in all trade stations filling to capacity and being surrounded by hundreds of trading vessels unable to dock. Trade completely dies as a result. You can probably survive on mining, passengers and missions but eventually I assume all 2nd tier and primary resource stations would eventually fill up as well.

6971,InterstellarPilots,"Useful strategies

A few useful strategies to make things easier for you:

1- use ships with a cloaking device(electronics bay) for npc trade and passenger runs to avoid losing them to bounty hunters and hostiles(so far, not a viable tactic with npc mining)

2- use ships with lower cargo capacities to have npcs avoid station gridlock easier(npcs want to sell their full load at one time; problematic if a station won't buy that much)

3- use a cloaking ship for attack missions(get behind the target while cloaked, decloak, fire full volley, recloak, recharge, repeat)

4- use fleet orders(button at bottom right of orders) to set aggression on npc ships to minimum(to the left), so they trade a larger variety of items(to avoid gridlock); also use fleet orders to set auto use for cloaking, or to flee to station automatically

BTW, the flyer is good for cloaked trading; the pioneer is good for cloaked passenger hauling;
Edit:the flyer is good due to max upgrade speed(64), and low-moderate cargo(30); the hornet is also good at up to 80 speed, and 20 cargo, but neither can have passengers

6984,InterstellarPilots,"Autopilot Ship Buying Guide

There's a lot of ships in the game, and when buying a ship for an autopilot task, you may wonder which ones are better for which task. Part of this depends on how you play the game. There's three basic styles of play, and each favors a different build. 

#Everyone is Hostile

So you've managed to make most of the factions Hostile? Don't worry, you can still have ships on Autopilot without worrying *too* much about them all getting blown up. The idea here is to make sure your ships are tough and heavily armed, to withstand attacks. You'll also want to provide escorts. Your merchant and passenger ships should be set to Attack, but not Intercept, hostiles, with a moderate Aggression. Miners should Attack and Intercept, with moderate Aggression, and escorts should Attack and Intercept with high Aggression.

**Trading**

If everyone hates you, who are you trading with? To keep your merchant fleet from getting blown up, use fully upgraded Creon-As. Missile payloads will diminish your trade capacity, so stick to low energy use weapons, such as lasers. You'll also be fending off small fighters much more often than cruisers or battleships, which you can outrun. Put photon weapons on your broadside and maybe one plasma weapon firing aft. A Creon's top speed is nearly 40, so escort with Pioneers instead of Flyers, so that the escort fleet can keep up. As an added bonus, the Pioneers can carry the missile payload that the merchant isn't. 

**Mining**

This is similar to Trading, with the caveat that your miners tend to stay in one place. Use the same build as your merchant fleet (with the addition of an Advanced Mining Laser, of course.) Escort them with Flyers, and build laser turrets in asteroid fields for added protection. 

#Taking Sides 

You've either pissed off the bad guys (bandits, rebels, and pirates) by working for the good guys (TEF, Lambda, Al-Ghat, DSMC, NWM) or vise versa. In some areas, your ships are relatively safe, while in others - not so much. One useful strategy to use is Interdiction: Assign a capital ship or a fleet of fighters to Protect your side of a wormhole leading to hostile space. Make sure to set them to Attack, Intercept, and max Aggression. This will stop random enemy patrols. Build Laser Turrets around allies' stations, to provide safe spaces for your merchants to run to.

**Trading**

Use the same strategy as given for Everyone Hates You, above, with the following changes: Using the Faction Options, ban your ships from trading in sectors hostile to you: and you may not need to spend money on escorts. Speed and defense is more important than firepower, so upgrade your shields and engines first - your ship can outrun enemies, and will lead them into safe spaces where they'll be outnumbered.

**Mining** 

You'll definitely want to limit your mining ships to one sector or another, to prevent them from wandering into hostile space. Set their base as a friendly Refinery, then limit them to 0 jumps. Caution- if you assign too many miners to a refinery, it'll get too full.

#The Switzerland Strategy 

So you've decided to be neutral to everyone, and no one wants to kill you? Then you have the biggest strategy change v instead of going for tough, heavily armed ships, you want fast ships.

**Trading**

The bane of every merchant is arriving too late with a cargo, and having to wait to sell it - or only being able to sell part of it. To avoid this, use Pioneers for merchants. They only carry 40, but they're faster than any other ship with a cargo hold, and you can buy more of them. 

**Mining**

Here, you want to go completely off the rails. The idea is to carry the largest cargo possible, and weapons don't matter: instead of using the Hauler-M, use the Hauler-H. The extra cargo space more than makes up for the missing weapon. The Creon still carries more cargo, so if you're willing to spend the cash, they're good too.



#Passenger Fares

There's no circumstance except extreme poverty where any ship besides a Pioneer-P with max engines is good for this role. The only comparable ship, the Hauler-P, may be sturdier, but it's slow and doesn't carry as many passengers. Nothing can catch Pioneers except Hornets, so if you're worried about them, use Hornets as escorts. Since they're not using their cargo hold, they can carry a good load of missiles as well.

If we're lucky, perhaps the developers will see this thread.

Here's the things I suggested in an email a while back: 

>In the Load Game screen, the pilot name is listed. This is always ""Player,"" and can't be changed by the player. It might make more sense for this to list the Faction field instead. It'd make it easier to differentiate between multiple saved games.


>NPC ships have access to two commands that players don't. I'd like to be able to order my ships to Scavenge and Patrol as well.


>The Properties list can quickly get massive later in the game. It'd be nice if there were Ship and Station tabs, and/or a Show Laser Turrets check box (such as with minor factions.)


>Is there a plan for alliances in the future? Factions have an Alliance entry, but it's never used.

6998,InterstellarPilots,"Can Factions Be Destroyed?

Short answer: sort of.

Long answer: Not completely. In my war with the bandits, I discovered that any station destroyed simply respawned when I wasn't looking, sending me on a never ending cycle of blowing up outposts and the occasional laser turret.

Then I dropped three laser turrets on the site where they rebuild. I did this every time I killed an outpost.

They can't rebuild, because as long as they're tagged Hostile, my turrets will open fire before their construction reaches 1%. They've dropped to the bottom of the faction list, and since outposts spawn fighters, I think we've seen the last of them.

Next I'll take on Black Sail. We'll see how this works with a larger faction. I'm concerned about blowing up trade stations, though - they're the only market for finished goods, and players can't build their own.

Edit: Bandit ships will respawn from Fortuna and Black Sail bases. I've now dropped turrets next to them as well. As an added bonus, this will give me a nice sneak attack when I go to war with them.",2016-11-24 20:16:46,7,0,-0.9621,-1,-1,1.0

I could swear it used to be that you could chain manual trade orders and they would do the trade once then delete (or re queue) the order. 
E.g. 1 trade alloy to vehicle plant, 2 trade chips to vehicle plant, 3 trade bikes to trade station. 

Now it seems to just loop the first trade order, I've tried then using max duration to time but it ends up with other problems/more micro managing.

Hey Y‚Äôall! Joined the sub today. Huge fan of the game, IP2 has so many cool features.

Scrolling through the sub, I enjoy a lot of the folks saying that they‚Äôd like to see the devs use much more of the game assets. They got me thinking‚Ä¶

What if the tractor beams were given an additional function to be able to pull wormholes, and cause either cataclysmic system end or temporal reality shift? In the case of the reality shift, rename stations, change the control of the sector from allies to enemies etc.?

about the physics of that, I just have questions. is it a matter of ship speed? Speed over 40 or 50; is it a matter of ship acceleration while latched onto wormhole? 

I think it‚Äôd be sick to see it work with a timer added counting you down to kind of escape before the sector collapses on itself lol. Also, encourages gameplay in smaller, faster ships!! Only perhaps! Cheers! üçª ",2024-10-09 20:12:20,7,0,0.947,1,1,1.0

# The IP2 v2.0.52 Rebalance Mod features the following:

* Performance improvements for low end devices which will aid tremendously in stability causing less crashes while playing large sectors.  Space fog has been completely disabled as well as the ""glob"" wormholes
* Sandbox Universe allows to create 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 sector count for custom universe play
* Sector sizes have been increased to 32k units; this makes for a much better ""space"" feeling while playing in a sector as well as it makes for a more tactical game-play to fortify a players stronghold within a sector
* All Ships & Stations have been re-scaled
* All Ships have been re-balanced
* All Stations have increased Hulls and Cargo
* All Weapons have been re-balanced
* All Shields, Capacitors, Engines & Generators have been re-balanced
* Stations can now equip larger Generators, Capacitors and Shields
* All non-essential bays are opened (essential bays are bays required for the ship to function as well as for special orders to take place such as mining orders & passenger transport orders)
* All Artillery are long-ranged weapons and require a minimum firing distance to use.  This creates a more TACTICAL STYLE of game-play.
* Lasers now miss; no more laser spamming from the NPCs or the Player just to win ... a fighter can now outmaneuver lasers and actually dog-fight.  Playing on full zoom in a fighter makes the game very immersive.
* Scratch cards give rewards; this is for the non-god-mode players so they can use it as a ""cheat"" for quick and easy credits
* Fixed the issue where NPCs would outfit their ships & stations with cloaks.  Basically the cloaking device is set back to its own unique bay, and only the X variants will be able to properly use it (as they should be only for the X variants).  All other variants will just have a free extra open bay; if the ship came pre-loaded with a cloak it might be there but it will not allow to be re-added if sold to non-X variants.
* Satellite scan range has been increased where 1 single satellite is enough to scan the entire sector.  The hull has been increased as well.
* Description text information screens have been updated so weapons will read their minimum & maximum firing ranges.
* All ""coming soon"" scenarios have been unlocked; now a player can enjoy the developers scenarios as they are fully accesible to play.
* All new Orion mesh, dubbed the Broadsword (no more clunky models in-game).
* Brand new Laser V; the most powerful of all weapons with long-reload time.  Only available for Overlord, Magnus & Stations (unless using the in-game cheat menu can equip on any ship).
* Mission payouts have been re-balance
* Might be forgetting what else changed ... but that's all can remember

Have fun and hope the mod is enjoyed by the community.

Cheers!

Hello, I'm new to Interstellar pilot 2 and kinda have a problem with automating my stations. So I used Shuttle to bring raw goods to be processed because they have an acceptable low cargo so that the raw materials won't overload the station cargo hold and Some Ventures to sell the processed goods.

The message didn't specify what's wrong, only ""time out"" Now I didn't activate the Max Duration options and I list the requeue one so the order will be indefinite. But they just keeps canceling. Station cargo is fine, plenty of room. And my Trade Station is well a trade station, it's got one heck of a cargohold. It always needs to be micro-managed and I admit it becomes kinda tedious. Can I have some advice on how to better the system or maybe I did something wrong? Any suggestions is appreciated.

Noticed the ships died in the glitched fleet (engine no work, can't turn, don't take orders, etc.) Luckily it wasn't that far back so I loaded an earlier save.

Also, I think the way you do the glitch may be to assign a bunch of ships to the fleet at once cause when ships are doing the ""join fleet"" task they technically aren't part of the fleet yet so you can make multiple ships join the fleet before the fleet number updates.

The GunStar is purely offensive. Player should be in the driver seat. Lots of reloading. On the plus side, this vessel is a nightmare for the enemy. I've actually had the game stop playing against me twice while engaging with this craft. 

The Outlander is a fantastic defense craft. It's great for defending high value property, never needs rearming and is fun to take into combat. Her armament allows her to face a variety of threats and she's more than competent in offensive engagements.

The Meteor is one of my newest vessels. She just kinda ""happened"" one day. You'll notice the laser IV configuration. This actually increases her rate of fire.

I thought it was some bandits (I didn't look at the inbox notificatiosns) so my ship repelled and destroyed them and the relation only got worse but i paid it off after some days when i saw they were attacking my station.
But they again broke the truce and i had to destroy their whole fleet and a station because although i paid for the truce they still attacked and so did my ships and truce broke.
After killing them all i again made truce but saw that it was some 700k credits but still paid it off and they were on red relation. Although i never attacked them they continued to break the truce and i can't pay 700k every single time. And now I can't even do thier missions to increase relation.

I understand that, at some point, you've got to just play the game how it was intended, but I feel like I've reached the ""I've conquered this, on all levels"" stage.  I'm conquering systems, almost at will.  I've conquered the economy (I can put MY refinery closer to the asteroids then theirs! , There are only 3 Light Weapons factories in this universe, 152 hospitals, and 9,000 outposts, time to make money!).  Am I missing something?

The empires stagnate (too slow), normal corps don't cause trouble.  If I stick to basic business (transport passengers, move cargo, mining, and building facilities in smart places), nobody causes trouble.

Hey everyone, I am curious as to what your favorite variants are to use in various situations.

I use a lot of mid-level overlords with bursters. I find that the burster's balance of moderate chance to hit with mid-level efficiency gives it overall utility against a variety of enemies. Usually, I put one Overlord-A with all proton burst III and a 120 generator in a fleet with 7 Flyer-A armed with all Proton Burst I. Since they are typically chasing the enemy their proton shots seem to be a lot more accurate against small enemies than the overlord, so once I can afford it I switch to a laser build on the overload-A. 

Late game, I tend to make fleets of:

1 - Magnus-A with three wide arc laser V and the rest of the smaller angle turrets equipped with laser III or IV, with two Anti-missiles on its two 360-degree turret slots. 

2 - Overlord-A with wide-angle laser V and the more narrow-angle turrets at laser III or IV. The rear turrets have laser III.

2 - Creon-A with proton burst III on wide angle and Plasma III on narrow-angle slots. Since these can only have weaker generators, capped at 52, I try to only use the more energy-efficient weapons on them.

3 - Ares-A with complete photon burst builds.

Since the Ares seem to work a lot better than the Creons, I've been tempted to go with 5 Areas and completely stop using the Creons outside of Currier missions. 

Please share your favorite methods and variants :)",2023-09-02 04:26:06,6,0,0.6936,1,1,1.0
7215,InterstellarPilots,"A suggestion to help lower spec systems

Hello again everyone,

Once I start to control about 1/4 or so of a 64-sector game, my computer starts to take 2+ minutes to find a trade route for any one fleet. It appears that the way the game calculates those routes can backlog in order to keep the frame rate up, which is a great thing as it can catch up when less fleets are finishing their runs, and queue when more fleets have recently finished a run.

However, for lower-spec systems in never catches up. 

I was wondering, is there any way to modify the code to allow the computer to catch up while the game is paused?

I often pause to check my maps when bandits pop up in several systems at once or to upgrade multiple buildings that just finished. However, that appears to pause all background computing as well, including trade route selection.

Why does the cloaking mechanism of Interstellar Pilot 2 automatically uncloacks ships when they take damage while they are on the process of cloacking? I've only observed this on Small Cloak devices, no matter what level it is, it still happens. I find it devastating when I'm on a fight and suddenly, the enemy decided to target lock and surround me, I pop it my level 4 version of the small cloak device that also has 50% damage reduction while cloaking/uncloaking in hopes of switching their targets on one of my other ships but as I do so, with their weapons still firing at me, my ship automatically uncloaks itself while playing the uncloak sound in the process, my hull health is now down to orange much faster than if I haven't cloak in the first place. Anyone else experience this? I don't know if it is the same case on the cloaks used for capital ships as I don't typically equip them with one.

The 1st game of Interstellar Pilot does not do this as far as I can tell. Don't get me started on detectable cloaked ships as long as you are within 250 units from them or so.

I tried making my own scavenging fleet, but they got distracted by some cargo about 4k away and all went there. I don't want to have to laser it all manually either, as that's pretty tedious.

So I've been playing interstellar pilot off and on for quite a while now (maybe 5-6 years?). Played IP1 on android and loved it. Got IP2 on android the day it came out and appreciated the changes. Had been waiting/hoping for a Linux specific (pc) version in one form or another pretty much since I first played it. Had never tried anything steam before, but found out they've got some emulation (or something) that makes it possible to play things on a Linux box that weren't written for Linux. So I tried it, and it works great (with void Linux. Probably other distros, too). It's FANTASTIC on a desktop. Even a not very high end desktop. Currently using a Lenovo m900 tiny with an i5-6600t and 8GB ram without any problems.

It could use more complete keybinds, or even better would be user definable keybinds (fire control, scanner access). What's there works, though. ",2023-07-04 08:39:28,7,0,0.9818,1,1,1.0

Some idea for ships:
Pure battleships (no hangar needed, just turret overload)
Carriers (exact opposite of a pure battleship, maybe just a couple turrets for sentinels, a ton of hangar, and that‚Äôs it)
Some kind of repair ship for long missions
Capital Warship (maybe not bought from a shipyard, but instead built like a station)
Bombers (strong turret but limited firing angle, not as manoeuvrable as fighters)
Station ideas:
Residential stations (kinda budget trade station for non planet sectors, buys food and water and generates credits)
Heavy weapons platform (no elaboration needed)
Defensive strongholds (station with large hangar, repair, good defence and a ship shop with frigates)
Weapons ideas:
Higher tier sentinel turrets
Tier V variant for all weapons
Make the artillery actually good, or some high tier artillery, it‚Äôs in a really weird spot
Railguns/Coilguns
Torpedoes (slow but strong missile)

7353,InterstellarPilots,"Last night lambda crashed the game lmao.

(this is in IP 2)

Playing in a very large sandbox, so what im guessing happened is the sandbox generated weirdly and none of the core sectors really connected, in this one lambda was consistently being very aggressive and expansionist and kept declaring war on factions that were on the other side of the map, 12-14 jumps. So they never launched any ships because the target sector was to far away... so the ships just kept building up in numbers.

Fortunately, I was in a roleplaying mood and was playing along with my neighbor faction who happened to hate lambda with its heart and soul. So it declares war and I also declare war on lambda. I send my primary fleet to wipe out lambda just for the fun of it, and what do ya know? Game lags like all hell when I enter Lambdas home sector, then immediately crashes as soon as I start attacking the enemy fleet. 

Fortunately I had a save before entering the sector so I booted that up, cloaked my fleet and dismantled my entire trade force, before re entering the sector and removing lambda from existence. Pretty sure my fleet shot down like 200 fighters and (i
I know this one for a fact) around 30 capital ships. Ooh boy the scavengers had some fun time with this. Watched a guy salvaging the cargo drops with 4 magnus class ships in tow that had been abandoned by lambda.

Just out of curiosity, why do mining ships, including my own, refuse to mine at this sector even though I have my own refinery set up on there. Meanwhile, I tried ordering my own mining ships to mine at this sector while setting my Refinery as their base and restricting to 0 jumps, yet they just sit there with the ""Mine"" order but they do not actually do so. I did wiped out the sector of Black Sail just a few days ago on my playthrough but it seems like those ships are still in a ""trauma"" or something. I also tried mining manually but it seems that the trade button on my refinery is grayed out, this shouldn't be the case if it is ""overflawing"" since only the sell button of Ice, Iron Ore, and Copper Ore are the ones usually grayed out in that case while the trade button works just fine.

7420,InterstellarPilots,"""Protect"" order BUG (Interstellar Pilot 1 version 1.6.7)

Moments ago, I get a mail stating that a property of mine is being attacked. It was a Hauler-M, mining some asteroids (as you can see from the variant) with an escort Flyer-X beside it under the ""Protect"" order in Terekos sector. So that ship is being attacked by a bounty hunter using an Ares so I jumped on to the ship protecting my Hauler, turns out, it just remained cloaked like having an objection to its intended job :D

I tried checking in the order settings and I have ""attack hostiles"" and ""intercept hostiles"" on with the aggression meter set at the middle, and with the prefer cloak option turned on obviously. That Flyer-X of mine refuse to do what it's supposed to do so I did a manual human intervention and attacked the bounter hunter myself, luckily I'd succeeded. My Hauler only suffered severe shield damage, fortunately no hull damage :D

But imagine, what if your main set of ships are battling something while your mining ships get attacked and their escorts refuse to protect them. Guess, I gotta make a hard decision into letting the AI controlling my main ship that I was using, and as you know because of the bug maybe my main ship will have the same issue as well. So back to the last paragraph, I also tried troubleshooting the problem by stopping the order set on my Flyer and setting its order to protect my Hauler yet again, this time it is now fixed when another bounty hunter attacked my Hauler again (well, hopefully)

7423,InterstellarPilots,"Interstellar Pilot 1: Energy Weapons ADJUSTMENTS! (version 1.6.7)

This article will contain all\* information regarding the current adjustments made to the energy weapons in the 1.6.7 update. All energy weapons received some adjustments regarding their ""efficiency"". Hope this will help you dear pilots, especially for those who are curious regarding as to how much damage they will now have.

\*In case I missed something, additions are welcome to the comments down below, thanks.

# Lasers

Sadly, the update done to lasers is no good. All variants now have the same efficiency amount (I guess pixelfactor should change the description of Laser I then). They still have same energy costs for all variants. Though, don't get yourselves comfortable because of the lower efficiency, its damage output will be severly hindered. (I'll explain later)

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|IV|V|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|1,000 Cr|4,500 Cr|23,000 Cr|56,000 Cr|112,500 Cr|
|Energy Cost|101.2|135|202.5|295.3|421.9|

|Charge Time (seconds)|7.5|7.5|8|9|9|
|Range|250|300|300|375|550|

# Plasma Pulse

Good news, pixelfactor finally paid attention to this sluggish yet lethal weapon (high risk, high reward). All variants got an increased efficiency, while still keeping the same energy cost.

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|2,750 Cr|9,000|29,000|

|Charge Time (seconds)|12|13.5|15|
|Range|300|350|475|
|Speed|150|125|100|

# Photon Burst

Last but not least, the photon burst also received some adjustments regarding its efficiency. Fortunately, it also relates to the Plasma Pulse in terms of the said adjustments.

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|3,500 Cr|7,200 Cr|21,250 Cr|

# Finding the actual damage of the weapons

Actually, the game does not provide a clear statement as to what the damage of your weapon is supposed to be. Luckily, efficiency is provided alongside the energy cost. To do this, assuming the efficiency is RELATED to the ""energy cost-damage ratio"" of the weapon, just MULTIPLY the energy cost with efficiency and you will get the weapon's damage.

**REMEMBER: Less efficiency means more amount for the ""energy cost"" compared to the ""damage"" of a weapon, hence the nerf of the laser's efficiency significantly hindered its damage output as you can see from the stats above. While more efficiency means more amount for the ""damage"" compared to the ""energy cost"" of the said weapon such as of the Plasma Pulse and Photon Burst.**

For example, a laser II's energy cost is 135 units, with an efficiency of 0.9, applying the formula for ""finding the actual damage of the weapons"", this means that it has a damage of 121.5 units in the current version. As for the prior version, it has an efficiency of 1.2, meaning it should deal 162 units of damage in its weaponry.

Another is for the Photon Burst I, it has an energy cost of 135 units as well, though with an efficiency of 1.1. Applying the formula as to how to solve for the damage of the weapon, we get 148.5 units worth of damage. In the prior version, with an efficiency of exactly ""1"", we get the same damage as with its energy cost which is 135 units, lol.

So logically, THE FIRST LEVEL of the Photon Burst is better than THE SECOND LEVEL of the Laser in regards to those examples. I hope you learned something, and thank you for reading! Have a great day pilot :D",2022-11-14 08:36:56,8,0,0.9598,1,1,1.0

Also, my faction is just 3 real life days old. Aptly named; ""Renzorps Inc.""

And yes, this is Interstellar Pilot 1.

ANYWAY, MY ARMY CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:
> Main Army
- 8 Flyer A (that includes me since I lead the group, no fleets assigned)

> Interceptors (decoys)
- 18 Raptor A (6 per fleet, all laser turrets)

> Reinforcement
- 6 Flyer X (just in case, all in one fleet)

HOW I USE IT
- I use my main army as sort of a patrol group to look out for any baddies lurking with in and out of my sector, especially I watch out for any distress calls.
- When raiding a station, I start out by making my ""interceptors"" go in as the frontline to see if there's enemy ships guarding that station, they could also inflict some primary damage since usually they outnumber my enemies. Unsurprisingly, some of them die in the process which is fine, because I could always buy some replacement provided I have economy income in the game. Seldomly, all of my ""interceptors"" could also get wiped out.
- Next, if the plan is successful, no wiping out happens, I would engage with my main group together with my ship and proceed to massacre their station to oblivion.
- As for my backups, they are just there to reinforce my group just in case my raptors get wiped out, and we are forced to fight since we are in the middle of the battlefield, enemy missiles locked on to everyone, I would order them to come as a last resort to kill my enemies. On the same occasion as my raptors are wiped out, one of my group died down since we are forced to stay in the fight for the enemies are locking down on us, F.",2022-10-09 13:01:20,8,0,-0.9962,-1,-1,1.0

7517,InterstellarPilots,"Finally updates after all these years!!

II've had some ideas over the years, and i literally can't supress my excitement that this game is getting updates again. These ideas of mine were

Station upgrades
Weapon upgrades (stats boost to existing weapons aside from just changing the weapon altogether)
Alien factions (invaders sort of)
Create ""custom role"" (more like preset instructions macro shortcut""

I just found this reddit sub so these ideas are probably suggested already, but here goes. 

Right now as you go on you end up building more and more stations, and at some point it just ends up as either a cluster that ships get stuck in or you're stuck having to place defenses on multiple clusters, this adding even more clutter, or build stations waaaaayy too far from each other. 

Station upgrades will probably solve this problem, with levels 1-5
Assuming a station that costs 1M credits
Lvl1 is base station

Lvl2 has 2x  Production (+ some stats upgrade but not 2x HP and shield for ""balance"" ) and costs (base price+ 10%) to upgrade, hence 1.1M

Lvl 3 has 3x production and some stat bonuses, for upgrade cost of 1.21M.

Lvl4 at 4x P, for upgrade cost of 1.331M

Lvl5 at 5x P, costing 1.4641M to upgrade.

Upgrade cost is +10% of preceeding level

Costs will probably be adjusted for balance, this just gives an idea.

As for balance and logic, it will probably be better to get at most lvl2 stations for the early game, only upgrading to higher levels later. Partly because it will cost more and partly because the station hp and shield doesn't scale the same as the production and capacity increase, so you need to have dedicated defense (which costs some more) lest you loose a lot for a single station. Also maybe make npcs more aggressive towards higher level stations

Another idea i have is the ""create custom role"", where you can save presets that contains orders, and behaviors, say ""trader passive"", agression at zero, aleays cloak, never engage and trade. Its a minor convenience, but over time it will add up to a lot especially when the credits go flooding in. 

As for alien faction, maybe make it so that they ""cross over"" to our galaxy using the unstable wormholes in the game, appearing at random sectors, with varying fleet strength everytime, say sometimes just recon forces, sometimes full on invasion fleet. Or two or more factions so some are friendly, some are not. 

Make it so that the aliens have ""special equipment"" that sometimes gets dropped when they are killed. Also you can use the unstable wormhole that the aliens came from to jump onto their sector. You can get trapped there tho, and can only bring 1 ship (along with docked ships)",2022-09-27 08:57:28,15,0,0.9375,1,1,1.0

After the arms race, TEF and Lambda were dumbfounded.   CLL Systems and ADR had backstabbed them into making them believe there was a war, only to steal credits right from under their noses.  They both felt betrayed, betrayed at everyone.

And so, they found comfort backstabbing others.

TEF had turned into a massive imperialist nightmare.  They used their brand new toys poking and prodding and small, independent factions.  They would regularly kidnap pilots that spoke out against their practices.  TEF believed, fanatically, it was their right to rule the entire universe.  Luckily, they never put this into action, but they had an absolute hatred of any other galactic power during their delusions.

Lambda became greedy beyond belief.   They would bribe and extort civillians to close off trade routes, so they and *only* them could access any goods.  Lambda would gouge prices to unbelievable heights, and when they rose the price of food rations to a factor of 4, the poor civillian workers died off in the thousands.  They attempted to make war against the ITP so they and *only* they controlled the trade.

For hundreds of years, the dark ages of the Uncharted Space ensued, and the universe became unlivable, just like the Sol System.   Whatever asteroids floated by were quickly mined, and then confiscated by Lambda or TEF.

*And so, like their ancestors, they looked out for answers.*

They detected a new wormhole a few units away from Beta Pindola.  This was their only hope at continuing humanity, but above all continuing their birth-right powertrip and an obsession with credits and trade.  They knew, like those first scientists, *there must be something on the other side.*

TEF, only fueled by the dream of expansion, and Lambda, only brought forth by the lure of vast riches, took the leap.

7639,InterstellarPilots,"VOL. 5 | THE ARMS RACE

The massive economic boom brought forth by the ITP called for the creation of newer, stronger ships to protect these vital trade routes.  Lambda, incredibly reliant on trade, developed a new solution to this problem, : **The Hornet.** The hornet was as quick as lightning,  and was cheap to produce.  An instant hit, it was used by criminals, cops, and citizens alike.   The X-Variant was developed by ADR Technologies, who were known for their civilian models and their experimentation with cloaks and radar jammers. 

TEF snapped back quickly with their personally developed, militarized **Flyer.**  Slower but stronger, it could easily disarm most ships in the universe.  It was co-produced by CLL Systems under their propaganda of Lambda hostilities.  Lambda made tTeheir own copies under ADR. 

Lambda was also working on a secret project, **The Magnus**. Although powerful, it was not a primary combat ship, but rather a mobile base and projection of force.  However, a bandit raid under the command of Keno Duerr stole a prototype and returned it to Black Sail.  Even after this, the Magnus began small scale production. 

TEF, after receiving news of this threat, (And propaganda from ADR), began work on the **Overlord** and **Ares.**  Incredibly powerful and highly useful, these were a mainstay of TEF for a long period of time.  

Lambda, with an even bigger need for trade, developed the **Orion** and **Creon**.  Designed for large scale trade across long distances, they were vital for the sustenance of Lambda's thirst for even more goods. 

TEF, rising to the occasion again, quietly began work on a new ship, **The Thunder**. Acting as both a frigate and interceptor, it could be used for both trade and conquest, and competed quite nicely against the Orion and Creon. 

This deathless war would continue for quite a while as both developed increasingly advanced military equipment.",2021-10-25 23:22:41,14,0,0.9075,1,1,1.0

# ECONOMIC BOOM

After the horrific ordeals of the war,  Rebel Collective grew to be scared of outside contact and instated a period of severe xenophobia.  They shut themselves off from the rest of the world yet struggled to build a self sufficient system, forcing them to go back to raiding refineries and shipyards for the very little scraps they could get their hands on.  They were just as powerful, yet were failing to grow at all, causing mass migrations toward neutral independent factions, which eventually spit up the Rebel Collective into a loose group of bitter trade partners.  The Rebel Collective owned a trade station in Rebel-controlled Terekos (known as the Laharan Republic), however that was destroyed in a testing range accident. 

The mining and trading sectors benefitted for the sudden demand, and experiences experienced an economic boom like nothing else.  NewHaven, DSMC, New World Mining, and Bluestar created the Intergalactic Trade Pact, which controlled 60% of all trade through various sectors.  New ships such as the Venture, Pioneer, and Hauler greatly contributed to the average miner and merchant's life. 

On the shadier side of things, Al-Ghat was mass producing Impulse, a recreational and military drug made to enhance worker performance and the mental acuity of Fighter Pilots.  A cheap, easy to get commodity, it caused several legal problems and was outlawed by the TEF.  Due to Al-Ghat's ties to the professional smugglers in Dymapa 753, and the dwindling supply of Galene materials to use,  they were able to produce it in the hands of smugglers with homegrown Dymapa-753 materials.  However, when most of the Impulse was siezed by TEF enforcers, these outlaws fiercely protected and hid their dwindling supply of the drug.",2021-10-25 22:45:27,12,0,-0.9756,-1,-1,1.0

# The Time of Dying

After conquering Solace and Dymapa 753, bandits rose to biblical levels of power and wealth.  They managed to do this while generally avoiding contact with the TEF, with the exception of the Pindolan War.  Most bandits were refugees from the Sol System facing political persecution, or financially destitute indentured workers from Orbital Farms and Refineries.  They generally were able to escape TEF rule by flying TEF ships in disguise into unchartered sectors and then being hauled off to rebel processing stations.

The Terran Expeditionary Force imposed trade embargoes towards factions  towards Black Sail, local bandit factions, and the Fortuna Rebels, from now known as the Rebel Coalition.   These underdeveloped territories formed into a loose conglomerate of rebel dissenters known as the Fortuna Rebels.  These rebels, along with the bandits, launched a massive surprise attack known as the Shipyard Massacre.  The rebel groups bombed the large shipyards in Gatopea wile Fortuna Rebels boarded and ransacked the stations.  The TEF, with the help of Lambda, responded to these attacks with a massive offensive into Dymapa 753.  This offensive failed, but with horrifying losses on both sides.

The Lambdan Navy lured the Rebel Coalition out of Solace and Dymapa 753.   The ensuing conflict was by far the largest military engagement in the entire universe, with millions of ships on both sides and spanning 5 sectors. The Lambdan Navy held out for just long enough for TEF to meet the battle in the outskirts of Galene and Hellemus, where the most intense fighting occurred. The battle lasted for 5 days in a series of grueling dogfights and ship boardings.  In the end, though, the rebels were the first to dip out of the battle.  As before, appalling casualties on both sides were not replenished for years.  The entire economy of the interstellar universe was in ruins.

*Historians estimate that about 1,771,700 ships were destroyed that day.  The total human death toll numbered approximately 3,000,000.  The average age was 21 years old.*",2021-10-23 18:42:50,15,0,-0.9949,-1,-1,1.0

# The Expansion Period

&#x200B;

Early on, all of the Sol System used Gatopea as an interstellar playground.  There was no limits, no laws, and a wild abundance of incredibly rare materials back on Earth.  At this time in history, this sector was originally an asteroid field, but that was quickly over-mined.   Some small expedition crews were sent to its flagship planet, where raw materials could be easily collected.

Expansion to other sectors became easy.  Androla and Hellemus became the go-to hub for mining and raw resources.  Terekos was the breadbasket of the new frontier.   They discovered a new planetary sector, Galene, which served as a trading post for exotic goods.  Expansion to Beta Pindola was difficult, as primitive bandit factions united to defend the area.  TEF captured them in a massive battle during the Great Pindolan War. Beta Pindola was the secondary major hub of the frontier.

Two new ships were created:  The Shuttle and the Raptor.  The Shuttle immediately outclassed the Ranger as the primary spacecraft, as it was both economical, and can be used for almost everything.  The Raptor was similar to the Shuttle and Ranger but was build with scouting and light combat in mind.

A number of factions were set up, including Lambda Corp, which originally specialized in cross-sector freight.   Al-Ghat was an exotic materials and weapons dealer that settled in Galene.  Nobody really liked them, but they were needed to keep TEF stocked with their navy.

The group of primitive bandits and runaway outlaws united under Black Sail, but were still divided into their own territories.   They generally avoided contact with anyone else, and set up bases in the previously undiscovered Dymapa 753.

After OPERATION CASBAH by Lambda, Solace was discovered, but was almost immediately overrun by bandits.  Solace was used by the bandits to produce arms and equipment, as well as the rallying point of the capitol ships.",2021-10-23 15:54:23,15,0,0.8854,1,1,1.0

***I am making a history of the Interstellar Pilot Universe.  This is volume one. Tell me what you think.***

# 

In 2230, a group of astronauts were manning a small orbital station, circling around Titan.  This station was a joint project conducted between the United American Federation (Modern USA), and the North African Republic (Modern Egypt).  On routine maintenance calls, they spotted a faint, strange object a few miles away.

&#x200B;

*It glowed a bright green.*

&#x200B;

Scientists had not seen anything like this before, although they knew fairly well that it was a wormhole.  The very thought of this shook civilization to its core.  They knew they had to test it, but were not ready to do it on humans.  They designed a few simple drones that would get in and get out of the wormhole.  These missions were a success, but they returned with high levels of radiation and with odd new chemicals attached to them.

They decided to build a craft with humans inside of it.  For 3 years, they used the best available technologies and every government in the Sol System were cooperating on a common goal.  The day came, and the 2 brave astronauts stepped inside the Vulcan-1.

The leap into the wormhole was only described by the pilots as a green tunnel obscuring your entire vision.  It was eerie and mind numbing.  But, according to them, it was worth it.  They ventured into a whole new galaxy, barraged with a onslaught of new experiences around them, all from the saftey of their own little ship.

&#x200B;

*They didn't see the meteor coming.*

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the radio signals did not make it in time, but the temperature and ionizers shifted dramatically.  They knew there was something on the other side.  These scientists, dedicated to their craft and their respective nations, worked hard to make this new hope possible.

The Vulcan-2 managed to return successfully.  They were anointed as heroes to mankind, and given millions of credits.  Most importantly, they set a basis of knowledge to allow more ships to venture in.

Eventually, a commercial model of the Vulcan-2 was made, now known as the Ranger-A.  Cheap to make and easy to operate, everyone in the Sol System used them.

Over the next few decades, a number of small colonies were made by different nations.  They united themselves under one common name:

&#x200B;

***The Terran Expeditionary Force.***

*And what did they call their new home?*

Sure, the game is pretty basic and simple, just a space adventure/light action mobile game.  But the way it goes about doing it is so well done.  It's a shame it was abandoned, this game is truly amazing. 

Each sector just has a different mood.  Gatopea has a big boom, industrial feel, and places like Solace or Hellemus have the feeling of isolated, gloomy bastions. 

You have the feeling you are the captian of your own humble ship.  The world is huge, and you genuinely feel like you are making progress as you gain power, wealth, and make alliances. 

The ships are detailed for such a simple game and it forces you to use your credits wisely on specific upgrades. The combat requires timing and the correct craft.  The economy feels alive and everything depends on one another.

However, it's also the small details. You can communicate to AI as you travel about the galaxy. You can scavenge recent battle sites and sell the scraps at a refinery.  You can group up ships and send them off to run errands for you.

I've played interstellar pilot for quite a while. However one thing that always irked me was the Black sail outpost: It always maxes out it's cargo space on junk. It'll be filled with missiles and mines picked up by scavengers, then once it reaches it's limit, the scavengers sit in it's hangar bay indefinitely. This wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that it acts as a refinery, meaning once it's filled up, my miners go and wait there as well, inside or outside. I would really like to see an extremely powerful black sail faction, and using it's refineries to fund the bandit faction. (As well as fortuna but that's different.

The only solution I've ever come up with is destroying the outpost. It's not all that risky if you don't have infrastructure yet in Dymapa, but it's infuriating I have to go out of my way to solve the problem.

And to clear up any ideas people may have, I have already tried filling up it's hangar bay BEFORE it maxes out. Ships still wait outside.

So after ""acquiring""(stealing) Magnuses from npc factionand and selling them, I looked around for a pirate stations to exterminate.I found an isolated station with three laser III and one laser V turrets.
After some scouting with a cloaked hornet, I found out four fighters that, after decloacking, bait them into the rest of my fleet: a magnus-a, two flyer-a and two thunder-a. Happy with the situation, I got back at the helm of my magnus, and this is where think start going bad. My hornet-x is destroyed in the opening salvo of the battle, surprised and concerned I take a look at the sector map and there is not four, not five nor seven... but a dozen fighters.

I immediately start firing my guns at them but after missiles and mines exploding all around me, my shield take some damages, but are still holding. The same happens to my fighters but some of their shields are nearly downs and one of the thunder got some hull damages. Trying to resolve the shields problem I start salvaging the battlefield, waiting for my shield to recharge, but the pirate weren't done yet they started sending small waves of fighter, not enough to do real damage but enough to make my shield recharge impossible.

And then I make my second error, I trusted the autopilot which following is programming started not to head back to my base but decided to engage the turrets... at very close range. Before I can react, one of the three laser III turrets is dead, grabbing the opportunity is redirected the shots towards the laser V turret and started throwing everything I had. Salvo after salvo of laser and rockets bring the turret down and started heading back to my base myself, but not before another wave of fighter got send my way. Those fighter broke my shield and begins firing directly into the hull.
I went away sure of myself and get back the with my tail between my legs, but I will come back stronger and this time will grab victory from my enemy.

7662,InterstellarPilots,"The ACTUAL best ship in the game for combat.

In Interstellar Pilot the prices of weapons do not scale linearly with their effectiveness, a weapon like a laser V, while \~5x more powerful than a laser I, is 100x more expensive. the same goes for shields and engines. this means that the cheaper option is usually better. for a fleet, you may want to buy a ton of fighters or a few capital ships. both of these options have serious flaws, in that even maxed fighters are cannon fodder, with only a max of 300 shields, and capital ships cost too much for their quite low shielding.  


 Frigates are the clear answer. with a max shielding of 600 (150 Shield points more than an Ares) and the ability to hold effective weapons like the Photon burst 2, these ships are amazing bang for buck, but you may have already known this. but which frigate is the best for a fleet? is it the Orion class?, or the supremely powerful thunder?, no.   


The humble Venture class frigate is the best combat ship, costing under 50k for the unarmed version the ship really does not have much going for itself. until when you realize that fully upgraded it's more powerful than a Ares. for a similar price. only around \~200k for upgrades, it'll become a maxed fighting unit that can beat an Ares! you could put 2 laser V turrets on your magnus for the same price and sure they may do slightly more damage, but those laser Vs aren't independently operating space craft. just 6 of these ships will destroy a magnus in 1 - 2 barages. that's only 1,200,000 for ships that can destroy MANY magnus' ain't that impressive?  


If anyone knows a strategy that's actually more effective percredit then let me know in the comments. however for now this is the definitive most efficient way to buy combat ships.  


    the Ideal config for a venture is as follows;
4x Photon burst II

I don't know if you guys already know about this or not, but here we go, you can steal a Capital ship(namely the Magnus and the Overlord)

First: max out your relationship with the faction who owns the ship, or enough so they allow you to dock in their Capital ships(preferably capital ships actively trading )

2nd: dock in their Capital ship after checking it's orders,  if it's trading or going back to base or repairing,  dock quickly before the capital ship docks in a station, then immediately undock from your own ship while inside the Capital ship, but stay in the capital ship, wait for it to dock in a station.

3rd: once the capital ship leaves the station on its own, it becomes yours, just like that, but make sure to cancel its current orders, and immediately change the ship's name(very important) and assign it to a fleet and give it orders to dock in your station or anywhere else, best if you sell it, you'll make around 980k-1.1M credits, and even better if you have a mission to deliver that very ship.

So, over the past month, ive been getting back into Interstellar Pilot. Nowadays, Im noticing more and more mechanics, and in game problems ive never noticed before. Below is what ive noticed about the Economic System, and the role bandits play in it.


So, i was flying through a system I had just cleared of bandits. The bandits were a mighty force to be reckoned with, and it was a hard fight, with alot of casualties for both sides. Before I cleared them out the system was buzzing with activity and trade, and had lots of Equipment Dealers patrolling around. Then, once I cleared out the bandits, it seemed to almost kill the economy in the system. All of the Equipment Dealers just up and left, as well as alot of the trade. In several systems, the factions who were based there began building stations of the same type they already had there, which ultimately killed the economy there fully. This got me thinking about the correlation between bandit presence, and trade.

After some digging, I began to realize just what role bandits played. Apparently, according to my findings in several saves, (and nearly causing the economy to die in all of them), every time that I killed a bandit group, the system in which they were located, was thrown off balance, and the economy crashed due to prices for goods going to high, and every time this happened, the faction up and left the system, for more favorable locations. The Bandits also bring a new sort of economy into play: the Ship economy. With Bandit presence in a system, it also brings Patrollers, Enforcers, and Bounty Hunters too. Factions that use these kinds of roles often have to buy new ships, and usually, in bandit systems, theres a military outpost placed there, to fuel the presence of these enforcer types of factions.

In the end of my digging, I realized that bandits are one of the sole reasons that systems have so much activity, whether it be trading, mining, or patrollers. Now, people may be wondering, ""If this is true, how do we prevent bandits from killing ships?"" This is quite simple.. you dont. Because of the bandit attacks, it brings in more patrollers. More patrollers means a military outpost, and maybe a repair shop are placed. More patrollers means more security, meaning more merchant ships come. The more merchant ships that come, the more stations that are placed. The more stations placed, the more bandit sttacks increase in size and intensity. Its all one big cycle, and, if you break part of it, the rest of it collapses.

7686,InterstellarPilots,"Mining Issues

Hey guys,

I have been playing in Universe 2, a wormhole too far, and I have amassed about 5 million credits. My main base of operations is at Beta Pindola, and I have established all the stations except for the refinery and the orbital farm. Now here comes the issue. There is a severe lack of nanochips. All the refineries in the universe have no nanochips in their cargo bay. This would mean that any product that requires nanochips cannot be produced (medipacks, hoverbikes, hypersleep pods and plasma rifles). This causes all trade to grind to a halt. So I was thinking, it could be because there was a lack of copper ore. However, all mining ships, including my own, are filled with ore, but cannot find a place to sell them. This may be a possible glitch, because I can manually sell the ore at any refinery, but on autopilot, the ships just cannot seem to be able to sell them. I was hoping you guys have an answer to this. Thanks!

In my universe, there are three hover bike suppliers. First one is in Dymapa, and it is still crawling with Black Sail activity, so most traders avoid that one.

And the third hover bike supplier belongs to me, I have plenty of supply, Galene and Beta Pindola trade stations demand the bikes, yet no one trades with my vehicle factory.

On top of that, no matter how much hover bike stock I build up, my vehicle factory always stays the most expensive option to buy from. Even the TEF one with absolutely no supply appears to be preferred over my factory.

7695,InterstellarPilots,"Refinery advice

Hi guys, 

Right now I have about 33 million credits, so I decided to try my luck with a refinery. I bought the parts, and deployed it in the dagola sector (type-b asteroids). I also purchased 4 hauler-m mining vessels and equipped them with advanced mining lasers. I am aware that it'd be best if I supply the raw materials myself. So the problem is, there are 2 other refineries in the sector, and my ships are selling the ore to the other refineries instead of transferring it over to mine. How am I supposed to go about this. Should I attempt to destroy the other 2 refineries, which may have potentially damaging implications? Or should I just ignore this? Thanks",2020-09-09 02:58:45,12,0,0.4865,1,1,1.0

7714,InterstellarPilots,"I sent Pixelfactor an email back in 2018 when I started playing. Fast forward to 2020 and I found out they're not updating anymore, which is sad. Down below is said email with some alterations. I still play this game BTW. Man I wish they came back.

Greetings, I am a new player that discovered this game a few weeks ago. It is fun, and as I'm going around blasting bandits I thought of some things that should improve the game.

Well, here are my suggestions:
1. Fleets. Able to create infinite numbers of fleets (and perhaps naming the fleet) consisting of any amount of ships.

2. Orders.
A. Resupply (auto or not): Have your ships resupply ammo, countermeasures, mines, etc. It works by setting a resupply base for the said ship along with the desired amount of the selected cargo to be resupplied on the particular ship. Example: An Orion gunboat with missile launchers all over, with a Magnus as a supply depot. When ordered to resupply, it will automatically dock at the Magnus and take the amount of the previously set cargo, let's say 25 Interceptors.
B. Auto resupply for stations. Works similary like the 'Resupply' order but in reverse. Example: A Brewery with a ship assigned to supply it with food grains. Once it ran out of said cargo (but still has cargo space available) the ship assigned to resupply it will buy the required resource.
I think it's best for this order to come with a ratio selector for stations that uses more than one commodity to produce another. Example: X_nanochips + X_alloys = X_plasma rifle. The supply ship will only supply the station according to the desired ratio. Meaning, if the station has 10a and 13b and it has a manufacture ratio of 2a : 3b = 5c, the supplying ship will only add 2b even though it has more, which will increase the station's inventory to 10a and 15b, thus conforming to said ratio. To make it less complicated, set the supply ships to resupply after the station has exhausted all its resources.
C. Upgrade. Order a ship to upgrade its components to a specific setting. You don't really need it if you only have one ship. But if you own 10 Haulers and want to buy equip a cloak for each one of them and you have to do it one by one, it gets tiresome and inconvenient.

3. Improved fleet settings. I have a Magnus and 3 Thunders docked in. They're set to 'prefer cloak' but when I order them to attack something, they just roam around near the target without doing anything, same with 'prefer dock' turned on.

4. Building mode. You can place stations at a specific location in the sector you are in. It makes your stations tidy, (I like to keep things tidy) especially when setting up laser perimeters. You can also move around already built stations in that sector.

5. Select ship. Select all, or some of your ships to execute an orde and alter fleet settings, including those in my suggestion. Example: You have 15 Orions and you want to turn them into gunboats, so you select all 15 and order them to 'upgrade' (swap, really) their turrets to have military launchers. Doing it one by one will be inconvenient. Example 2: You have 15 Haulers and you order them to trade while also turning off 'intercept hostiles' option in their fleet settings while also turning on 'prefer cloak' option.

6. Hauler M fix. The second mining turret won't work when the Hauler M is ordered to mine.

Well, this is what came up in my mind while playing. I hope it could be implemented to the game and create a positive impact to all other players. Thank for you creating such a great game. I've rated the game 5 star on Google Play, BTW. I hope it helps.",2020-07-11 03:58:54,17,0,0.9946,1,1,1.0

Hi guys, 

I have a couple of questions regarding stations. 

Firstly, how do my stations obtain supplies? My guess is that other NPC traders come to my stations and sell the required materials to my station for production.

Secondly, I have noticed that there are insufficient NPCs who come to my stations to supply them with goods to produce, fewer than those who come to my station to buy the product (eg. not enough food grains to produce pindolan ale). As such, I want to build my own orbital farms etc to supply my own stations. When the, say for example, grains are ready, do they automatically transfer to the brewery for production, or do I have to do it manually?

Thirdly, if I have to transfer manually, is it possible to transfer it using autopilot?

Fourthly, how can I ensure that I have a continuous supply of the required goods, because I am losing a lot of buyers?

I mean I could just keep transferring the cargo but that would be tedious I have many stations.

Hi everyone,

I'm fairly new to this game, what is the difference between ""attack hostiles"" and ""intercept hostiles"" in the fleet options.

Yes my tactic is a bit of exotic but it works all the time.

1. Start with a Hornet. Do some trading or jobs so you can hire a little fleet of other small ships. Then raid merchants.üòä

2. With the Money you get buy a little Hornet fleet. With them you can raid more and and more for more profit. If you want more support buy some Shuttles and start your own Cup Company. I works pretty good

3. With a small raiding fleet and a small economy fleet you can star to militarise your faction. I buy usually 2 or 3 Overlords.
My tactic to conquer a system(Dymapa 753) is rush the enemy with Hornets and destroy them with long range artillery support from my Overlords. It works pretty good. Because I don't got the Money for Stations but for more big Ships I buy a few Magnus X for trading. Because of the great Trading space you gain a big profitüíµ.

Wouldve been nice if they make a class that has no shields but the hull integrity is really high, especially the front. The front of the ship is slightly pointed, and has the ability to ""dash"" at a small distance and ""ram"" whatever target is in front of the ship, sacrificing a small percentage of hull integrity and breaking the enemies' shields. Good against stations and battlecruisers. This is one of those ships that are not really necessary but can be beneficial. 

EDIT:  I guess the downside of it (for balancing purposes) is it has no weapons and docking bays? The ships needs to be protected if you want to use it.

My issue is the escorts never seem to do anything but ghost along silently.  The thought it they stay cloaked until an enemy engages, then they should decloak and start attacking any enemy threatening their parent vessel.  After the fight, they ought to recloak and wait for the next fight, slowly rebuilding their energy levels.

&#x200B;

What seems to be happening is they just remain in a cloaked state and let the enemy pound away on the Magnus shielding with impunity as if they were zero aggressive and were set to not attack anything at all.  My thought is the cloaks are keeping them from doing more than silently ghost along.

This will be my opinion on changes in 1.6.0 that I already know.

1. Mining Laser
   You can't buy Mining Laser and Adv. Mining Laser anymore (or they just changed the buying shop, it was on Refinery before). This is bad for me. Hauler-H miner is actually really good.

2. Interface Layout
   The cargo trade and equipment screen is much neater and easier to navigate. Pretty good especially if you have something specific to buy and don't want to waste time pressing arrow buttons to look at every cargo.

3. Mercenary AI
   A nice addition, helps for station attacks. Pretty cheap too. Only if there were more of them.

4. Autopilot Orders
   The ""Repair to Nearest"" order is a nice touch. It saves time. Maybe next update dev should add Scavenge, Patrol and Explore commands.

5. Friend Bar Glitch
   This is a glitch (I think it isn't meant to be added) that I found where the Friendliness meter exceeds the maximum. This actually is a big help, since they give REALLY GOOD prices. There's one station where every equipment upgrade costs 0 Credits. One of the Shipyards sells Arms Factory parts for 200 thousand Cr, and buys them back for 2 million Cr.

--> Cloaking device on AI controlled Capital ship used for combat is a big NO NO NO.

I have an Overlord with a full compliment of Orion-X frigates with 2 Ares-X escorts as my main combat fleet. After several rounds of fighting missions i noticed that my Ares's hull are frequently damaged. I found the culprit to be the Cloaking Device because these Ares would always want to cloak during the thick of the battle. I then disabled its preference to cloak but the cloaking still happens during battle. So I then manually disabled the component itself but as soon as I issued an order the cloaking device is magically enabled again.. I think this is a bug

Nothing is wrong with my Orions because they can appear/disappear in just 1.2 sec (using the best cloaking device available for them) but the Ares and my Overlord takes 5 sec to do the same. During this period the ship drops shield and it very vulnerable to enemy fire.

Equipable armors that would protect electronics from EMP woepons maybe Corrosion ressistant armor wich lowers the effect of corrosion cannons and maybe armor wich absorbs energy from laser woepons and add it to your capacitator buff the plasma weopons a bit theyre underpowered as a repeating issue that everyone uses nothing but lasers its kinda dull and boring and i want to see more variety wich means different weopons ships equipment in fleets and everything wich would make multyplayer if it would ever come even more entertaining as you have so much to choose from. Also i have more on a bigger set of commodoties make like gatopean gas that you can mine out of the planet wich would make mining also more interesting add starts where you can extract helium and hydrogen from them. To fix the issue of long times of travelling make a cruise drive wich would speed you up to 300 speed but drop your shields and impair your weopons kinda like cloak. Make stations a bit more interactive like the space lounge in galaxy on fire 2 wich was a cool feature like multiple bars where you can talk to poeple like in the com logs and recruit them to your fleet or hire them as mercenaries or make deals whit commodoties",2017-02-24 19:33:49,3,0,0.9418,1,1,1.0

Some ideas!

‚Ä¢ New weapons, notably for smaller ships, as they tend to get outgunned easily even against their equals if energy isn't managed right.

‚Ä¢ Energy focus! Being able to redirect energy flow into certain components, mostly shield directions, engines, and weapons.

‚Ä¢ Adding the Comms system from Scenarios into Universe, to help make the game more alive. This could also lead to hiring wingmen, as seen in the first scenario, or even bargaining with enemies to keep them from blowing your ship to dust.

‚Ä¢ 'Magnus-F' flagship class, housing 10 docking bays of Frigate or below, has 'small' weaponry purchasable inside (Frigate and below), and has Repair Facilities. To balance things out, it could lack shields, instead having a 10 second 'Flagship' cloaking device, prompting a more defensive usage.

7870,InterstellarPilots,"IP Review

Hi!  :) I'm just giving a review, mostly for the purposes of the designer ;)


IP  is probably one of the best mobile platform space trader Sims out there. Having played things like space traders, into the void, and alite, this game stands on top as the most seamless and immersing experience in my eyes. The game is also well priced, with a small purchase needed to unlock late game ships. The graphics can stand on the same ground as something like Harbinger. However, this game has some deep, between the cracks flaws which keep it from realizing it's full potential. 

It's been a long time since any game has sucked me into the game play and made me feel like I'm there. A lot of my game buying experience is a desperate search for immersion and this game delivers. Traveling from one end of a universe to the other feels like a trek (especially with full fleets), you gain a real sense of accomplishment as you go from a single ship to 8 full fleets, and the universe you're put in will progress with you so that every day in game is a new day. The graphics can be down right beautiful at times; I had a sector filled with ice comets and an earth like planet which took my breath away. That sector is my home sector :)

Since this review is mostly for the developer, it will be more heavy on the criticisms since I'll be going into more detail. Please don't get me wrong, this game is a 4/5 for me at the moment and so tantalizingly close to 5 stars. 

First, let's talk about controls. The first suggestion I'll make before any other is every window needs a close box/X. It's pretty annoying to have to press back 4 times and then undock after searching for prices through the trader at an outpost. This situation of having to press back many times pops up pretty often and simply adding a close window option to the log window and others would be a massive quality of life improvement. It would also be nice if the camera could remember the distance you set it to instead of always defaulting to somewhere far. While we're talking about the camera, a free look function would also be awesome to have; I've been resorting to locking my camera and targeting outpost around a sector to get a good look. 

Also in line with controls is the actual act of trading. It can get tedious when you have to constantly switch ships or cargo to fill a fleet with goods or sell your goods. I think it should be possible to buy goods in one ship in a fleet and have any excess goods overflow into the other ships in the fleet and vice versa for selling, especially with the buy/sell as many as possible buttons in the trading interface. Another nice addition would be the ability to select systems in the galaxy map, see a list of stations, and be able to scan those stations.  This would be a massive quality of life improvement. 

In terms of graphics, I think adding life bars above the targeting reticles would be awesome. It can be tough to keep track of which ships need to be pulled out of a fight to keep them from being destroyed. 

Now let's talk game play. I have a lot to say here. 

Firstly, diplomacy and faction competition is really bare bones at the moment. Sure, there are individual factions, but the alliance lines are very cut and dry; there are good guys and bad guys and that's about it. You attack one good guy (even though the game says they have no allies) and you lose favoring with all good factions, which is most factions unfortunately.  It was pretty disappointing to find out I couldn't start a war with a competing faction because I'd become an enemy of every faction in their moral alignment. 

So why would I want to start a war? This game has a disappointing lack of conflict. Yes, you can have bounties on your head which will cause bounty hunters to chase you, and you might get the stray bandit capital ship raiding other ships, but by enlarge the bandits just have their assess handed to them. I've yet to see bandits take over whole systems or launch fleet sized raids. Just war in general hasn't  popped  up in this game, yet this game has all the elements for war. This game even has all the elements for trade war, but the pricing engine doesn't create a very diverse economy. You'll have a few systems offering different prices, but for the most part most stations offer the same prices, and even when there is variation it doesn't ever feel meaningful. Thankfully, where the stations are positioned and the quantity of goods they have does create meaningful diversity, but the pricing does need attention. This game is sort of in a state where you feel way too free yet constricted at the same time.

Here's my suggestions:
-moral alignment needs to go away and be replaced with more explicit alliances. As long as it's not just everybody who is honorable is now an ally, this will diversify and give more meaning to diplomacy. Instead of just asking yourself if you want to be evil, crooked, or honorable, you can ask do you want to be with the merchant clan, or the war clan, or the intellectual clan, for example. This can be accomplished by having factions that build outposts that support each other be allies (like if a refinery and small arms factory are in the same sector) and enemies if they compete (two refineries in the same sector). Trade could also increase alliance between npc factions. I think a bandit faction is still a good idea
-diplomacy also needs more depth. You're either at war with a faction or they don't care about you. Actual alliance or positive moral favor doesn't really bring any meaningful rewards besides not being at war with that faction. I think something like lowered or raised prices would be a good start. 
-bandits, especially during the late game, need to be more threatening. They need to start trying to take over whole systems and actually succeed in some cases. I want to see my trade routes disrupted and my authority in a sector challenged. 
-diplomatic relationships should decay, and what improves your standing with a faction should be limited so you can't be friends with ALL the good or bad guys, and they should be able to deteriorate to war, especially with crooked factions. Simply trading with one faction or doing their missions shouldn't give you favor with every faction of that moral alignment in my opinion
-I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation, but I'd like 50+sector universes



If you can't tell, I think this game holds the most potential in diplomacy. I think with just a few adjustments this game could really be a 5 star experience.

7875,InterstellarPilots,"Luxury Resources not Decaying in Custom Universe

In the preset universes the top tier resources (jewellery, hoverbikes, medkits etc) slowly disappear from the trade station. This is essential because stations have finite storage and nobody can buy top tier resources once they are sold to a trade station. This slow decay doesn't appear to occur when you play custom.

This results in all trade stations filling to capacity and being surrounded by hundreds of trading vessels unable to dock. Trade completely dies as a result. You can probably survive on mining, passengers and missions but eventually I assume all 2nd tier and primary resource stations would eventually fill up as well.

7878,InterstellarPilots,"Useful strategies

A few useful strategies to make things easier for you:

1- use ships with a cloaking device(electronics bay) for npc trade and passenger runs to avoid losing them to bounty hunters and hostiles(so far, not a viable tactic with npc mining)

2- use ships with lower cargo capacities to have npcs avoid station gridlock easier(npcs want to sell their full load at one time; problematic if a station won't buy that much)

3- use a cloaking ship for attack missions(get behind the target while cloaked, decloak, fire full volley, recloak, recharge, repeat)

4- use fleet orders(button at bottom right of orders) to set aggression on npc ships to minimum(to the left), so they trade a larger variety of items(to avoid gridlock); also use fleet orders to set auto use for cloaking, or to flee to station automatically

BTW, the flyer is good for cloaked trading; the pioneer is good for cloaked passenger hauling;
Edit:the flyer is good due to max upgrade speed(64), and low-moderate cargo(30); the hornet is also good at up to 80 speed, and 20 cargo, but neither can have passengers

I plan to update this over time, so any strategies you find would be appreciated, and edited into this post(with origin credit); feel free to suggest strategies in comments, or via messages.",2017-02-08 01:56:20,7,0,0.9267,1,1,1.0

Another tactic is the .99 cent fighter can be fit with 5 military launchers and take out any capital ship, leading to much lol's and 12k worth of loot.
Another stone age tactic if this game continues to be developed.

7891,InterstellarPilots,"Autopilot Ship Buying Guide

There's a lot of ships in the game, and when buying a ship for an autopilot task, you may wonder which ones are better for which task. Part of this depends on how you play the game. There's three basic styles of play, and each favors a different build. 

#Everyone is Hostile

So you've managed to make most of the factions Hostile? Don't worry, you can still have ships on Autopilot without worrying *too* much about them all getting blown up. The idea here is to make sure your ships are tough and heavily armed, to withstand attacks. You'll also want to provide escorts. Your merchant and passenger ships should be set to Attack, but not Intercept, hostiles, with a moderate Aggression. Miners should Attack and Intercept, with moderate Aggression, and escorts should Attack and Intercept with high Aggression.

**Trading**

If everyone hates you, who are you trading with? To keep your merchant fleet from getting blown up, use fully upgraded Creon-As. Missile payloads will diminish your trade capacity, so stick to low energy use weapons, such as lasers. You'll also be fending off small fighters much more often than cruisers or battleships, which you can outrun. Put photon weapons on your broadside and maybe one plasma weapon firing aft. A Creon's top speed is nearly 40, so escort with Pioneers instead of Flyers, so that the escort fleet can keep up. As an added bonus, the Pioneers can carry the missile payload that the merchant isn't. 

**Mining**

This is similar to Trading, with the caveat that your miners tend to stay in one place. Use the same build as your merchant fleet (with the addition of an Advanced Mining Laser, of course.) Escort them with Flyers, and build laser turrets in asteroid fields for added protection. 

#Taking Sides 

You've either pissed off the bad guys (bandits, rebels, and pirates) by working for the good guys (TEF, Lambda, Al-Ghat, DSMC, NWM) or vise versa. In some areas, your ships are relatively safe, while in others - not so much. One useful strategy to use is Interdiction: Assign a capital ship or a fleet of fighters to Protect your side of a wormhole leading to hostile space. Make sure to set them to Attack, Intercept, and max Aggression. This will stop random enemy patrols. Build Laser Turrets around allies' stations, to provide safe spaces for your merchants to run to.

**Trading**

Use the same strategy as given for Everyone Hates You, above, with the following changes: Using the Faction Options, ban your ships from trading in sectors hostile to you: and you may not need to spend money on escorts. Speed and defense is more important than firepower, so upgrade your shields and engines first - your ship can outrun enemies, and will lead them into safe spaces where they'll be outnumbered.

**Mining** 

You'll definitely want to limit your mining ships to one sector or another, to prevent them from wandering into hostile space. Set their base as a friendly Refinery, then limit them to 0 jumps. Caution- if you assign too many miners to a refinery, it'll get too full.

#The Switzerland Strategy 

So you've decided to be neutral to everyone, and no one wants to kill you? Then you have the biggest strategy change v instead of going for tough, heavily armed ships, you want fast ships.

**Trading**

The bane of every merchant is arriving too late with a cargo, and having to wait to sell it - or only being able to sell part of it. To avoid this, use Pioneers for merchants. They only carry 40, but they're faster than any other ship with a cargo hold, and you can buy more of them. 

**Mining**

Here, you want to go completely off the rails. The idea is to carry the largest cargo possible, and weapons don't matter: instead of using the Hauler-M, use the Hauler-H. The extra cargo space more than makes up for the missing weapon. The Creon still carries more cargo, so if you're willing to spend the cash, they're good too.



#Passenger Fares

There's no circumstance except extreme poverty where any ship besides a Pioneer-P with max engines is good for this role. The only comparable ship, the Hauler-P, may be sturdier, but it's slow and doesn't carry as many passengers. Nothing can catch Pioneers except Hornets, so if you're worried about them, use Hornets as escorts. Since they're not using their cargo hold, they can carry a good load of missiles as well.

7905,InterstellarPilots,"Can Factions Be Destroyed?

Short answer: sort of.

Long answer: Not completely. In my war with the bandits, I discovered that any station destroyed simply respawned when I wasn't looking, sending me on a never ending cycle of blowing up outposts and the occasional laser turret.

Then I dropped three laser turrets on the site where they rebuild. I did this every time I killed an outpost.

They can't rebuild, because as long as they're tagged Hostile, my turrets will open fire before their construction reaches 1%. They've dropped to the bottom of the faction list, and since outposts spawn fighters, I think we've seen the last of them.

Next I'll take on Black Sail. We'll see how this works with a larger faction. I'm concerned about blowing up trade stations, though - they're the only market for finished goods, and players can't build their own.

Edit: Bandit ships will respawn from Fortuna and Black Sail bases. I've now dropped turrets next to them as well. As an added bonus, this will give me a nice sneak attack when I go to war with them.",2016-11-24 20:16:46,8,0,-0.9621,-1,-1,1.0

# Happy Holidays,

As you may know, both games have been taken down from the Google Play Store, likely due to policies regarding developer inactivity. The developer, Pixelfactor, has been notified about this issue; however, the timeline for the games' reinstatement remains uncertain. In the meantime, here are alternative methods to access the most recent versions of both games. (APKPure)

7977,InterstellarPilots,"Installed this a week ago, might be best mobile game I've EVER played.

I picked up this game a week or two ago.  I am absolutely blown away by how much this game brings to the table

Sure, the game is pretty basic and simple, just a space adventure/light action mobile game.  But the way it goes about doing it is so well done.  It's a shame it was abandoned, this game is truly amazing. 

Each sector just has a different mood.  Gatopea has a big boom, industrial feel, and places like Solace or Hellemus have the feeling of isolated, gloomy bastions. 

You have the feeling you are the captian of your own humble ship.  The world is huge, and you genuinely feel like you are making progress as you gain power, wealth, and make alliances. 

The ships are detailed for such a simple game and it forces you to use your credits wisely on specific upgrades. The combat requires timing and the correct craft.  The economy feels alive and everything depends on one another.

However, it's also the small details. You can communicate to AI as you travel about the galaxy. You can scavenge recent battle sites and sell the scraps at a refinery.  You can group up ships and send them off to run errands for you. 

&#x200B;

Sure, other games are more nostalgic, some are more complex, some have better graphics and player input.  But this game feels so alive and truly hits different.

7993,InterstellarPilots,"The Economic System

So, over the past month, ive been getting back into Interstellar Pilot. Nowadays, Im noticing more and more mechanics, and in game problems ive never noticed before. Below is what ive noticed about the Economic System, and the role bandits play in it.


So, i was flying through a system I had just cleared of bandits. The bandits were a mighty force to be reckoned with, and it was a hard fight, with alot of casualties for both sides. Before I cleared them out the system was buzzing with activity and trade, and had lots of Equipment Dealers patrolling around. Then, once I cleared out the bandits, it seemed to almost kill the economy in the system. All of the Equipment Dealers just up and left, as well as alot of the trade. In several systems, the factions who were based there began building stations of the same type they already had there, which ultimately killed the economy there fully. This got me thinking about the correlation between bandit presence, and trade.

After some digging, I began to realize just what role bandits played. Apparently, according to my findings in several saves, (and nearly causing the economy to die in all of them), every time that I killed a bandit group, the system in which they were located, was thrown off balance, and the economy crashed due to prices for goods going to high, and every time this happened, the faction up and left the system, for more favorable locations. The Bandits also bring a new sort of economy into play: the Ship economy. With Bandit presence in a system, it also brings Patrollers, Enforcers, and Bounty Hunters too. Factions that use these kinds of roles often have to buy new ships, and usually, in bandit systems, theres a military outpost placed there, to fuel the presence of these enforcer types of factions.

In the end of my digging, I realized that bandits are one of the sole reasons that systems have so much activity, whether it be trading, mining, or patrollers. Now, people may be wondering, ""If this is true, how do we prevent bandits from killing ships?"" This is quite simple.. you dont. Because of the bandit attacks, it brings in more patrollers. More patrollers means a military outpost, and maybe a repair shop are placed. More patrollers means more security, meaning more merchant ships come. The more merchant ships that come, the more stations that are placed. The more stations placed, the more bandit sttacks increase in size and intensity. Its all one big cycle, and, if you break part of it, the rest of it collapses.

Hope you enjoy what I have found, and good luck, fellow pilots!",2021-01-18 19:41:33,23,0,-0.4116,-1,-1,1.0

7999,InterstellarPilots,"Interstellar Pilot Mod 2.0.52 (released & unofficial)

# The IP2 v2.0.52 Rebalance Mod features the following:

* Performance improvements for low end devices which will aid tremendously in stability causing less crashes while playing large sectors.  Space fog has been completely disabled as well as the ""glob"" wormholes
* Sandbox Universe allows to create 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 sector count for custom universe play
* Sector sizes have been increased to 32k units; this makes for a much better ""space"" feeling while playing in a sector as well as it makes for a more tactical game-play to fortify a players stronghold within a sector
* All Ships & Stations have been re-scaled
* All Ships have been re-balanced
* All Stations have increased Hulls and Cargo
* All Weapons have been re-balanced
* All Shields, Capacitors, Engines & Generators have been re-balanced
* Stations can now equip larger Generators, Capacitors and Shields
* All non-essential bays are opened (essential bays are bays required for the ship to function as well as for special orders to take place such as mining orders & passenger transport orders)
* All Artillery are long-ranged weapons and require a minimum firing distance to use.  This creates a more TACTICAL STYLE of game-play.
* Lasers now miss; no more laser spamming from the NPCs or the Player just to win ... a fighter can now outmaneuver lasers and actually dog-fight.  Playing on full zoom in a fighter makes the game very immersive.
* Scratch cards give rewards; this is for the non-god-mode players so they can use it as a ""cheat"" for quick and easy credits
* Fixed the issue where NPCs would outfit their ships & stations with cloaks.  Basically the cloaking device is set back to its own unique bay, and only the X variants will be able to properly use it (as they should be only for the X variants).  All other variants will just have a free extra open bay; if the ship came pre-loaded with a cloak it might be there but it will not allow to be re-added if sold to non-X variants.
* Satellite scan range has been increased where 1 single satellite is enough to scan the entire sector.  The hull has been increased as well.
* Description text information screens have been updated so weapons will read their minimum & maximum firing ranges.
* All ""coming soon"" scenarios have been unlocked; now a player can enjoy the developers scenarios as they are fully accesible to play.
* All new Orion mesh, dubbed the Broadsword (no more clunky models in-game).
* Brand new Laser V; the most powerful of all weapons with long-reload time.  Only available for Overlord, Magnus & Stations (unless using the in-game cheat menu can equip on any ship).
* Mission payouts have been re-balance
* Might be forgetting what else changed ... but that's all can remember

Have fun and hope the mod is enjoyed by the community.

Cheers!

8017,InterstellarPilots,"The ACTUAL best ship in the game for combat.

In Interstellar Pilot the prices of weapons do not scale linearly with their effectiveness, a weapon like a laser V, while \~5x more powerful than a laser I, is 100x more expensive. the same goes for shields and engines. this means that the cheaper option is usually better. for a fleet, you may want to buy a ton of fighters or a few capital ships. both of these options have serious flaws, in that even maxed fighters are cannon fodder, with only a max of 300 shields, and capital ships cost too much for their quite low shielding.  


 Frigates are the clear answer. with a max shielding of 600 (150 Shield points more than an Ares) and the ability to hold effective weapons like the Photon burst 2, these ships are amazing bang for buck, but you may have already known this. but which frigate is the best for a fleet? is it the Orion class?, or the supremely powerful thunder?, no.   


The humble Venture class frigate is the best combat ship, costing under 50k for the unarmed version the ship really does not have much going for itself. until when you realize that fully upgraded it's more powerful than a Ares. for a similar price. only around \~200k for upgrades, it'll become a maxed fighting unit that can beat an Ares! you could put 2 laser V turrets on your magnus for the same price and sure they may do slightly more damage, but those laser Vs aren't independently operating space craft. just 6 of these ships will destroy a magnus in 1 - 2 barages. that's only 1,200,000 for ships that can destroy MANY magnus' ain't that impressive?  


If anyone knows a strategy that's actually more effective percredit then let me know in the comments. however for now this is the definitive most efficient way to buy combat ships.  


    the Ideal config for a venture is as follows;
4x Photon burst II 
    (Better DPS than the laser II and fast enough to hit ship unlike plasma II)
    1x Max Engine
    1x Max Generator
    1x Max ECM, with ECM II
    1x Max capacitor
    1x Shield 500

*Exploration turns into curiosity.*

*Curiosity turns into hatred.*

*Hatred turns into violence.*

*Violation turns into isolation.*

*Isolation turns into exploration.*

&#x200B;

After the arms race, TEF and Lambda were dumbfounded.   CLL Systems and ADR had backstabbed them into making them believe there was a war, only to steal credits right from under their noses.  They both felt betrayed, betrayed at everyone.

And so, they found comfort backstabbing others.

TEF had turned into a massive imperialist nightmare.  They used their brand new toys poking and prodding and small, independent factions.  They would regularly kidnap pilots that spoke out against their practices.  TEF believed, fanatically, it was their right to rule the entire universe.  Luckily, they never put this into action, but they had an absolute hatred of any other galactic power during their delusions.

Lambda became greedy beyond belief.   They would bribe and extort civillians to close off trade routes, so they and *only* them could access any goods.  Lambda would gouge prices to unbelievable heights, and when they rose the price of food rations to a factor of 4, the poor civillian workers died off in the thousands.  They attempted to make war against the ITP so they and *only* they controlled the trade.

For hundreds of years, the dark ages of the Uncharted Space ensued, and the universe became unlivable, just like the Sol System.   Whatever asteroids floated by were quickly mined, and then confiscated by Lambda or TEF.

*And so, like their ancestors, they looked out for answers.*

They detected a new wormhole a few units away from Beta Pindola.  This was their only hope at continuing humanity, but above all continuing their birth-right powertrip and an obsession with credits and trade.  They knew, like those first scientists, *there must be something on the other side.*

TEF, only fueled by the dream of expansion, and Lambda, only brought forth by the lure of vast riches, took the leap.

8081,InterstellarPilots,"I sent Pixelfactor an email back in 2018 when I started playing. Fast forward to 2020 and I found out they're not updating anymore, which is sad. Down below is said email with some alterations. I still play this game BTW. Man I wish they came back.

Greetings, I am a new player that discovered this game a few weeks ago. It is fun, and as I'm going around blasting bandits I thought of some things that should improve the game.

Well, here are my suggestions:
1. Fleets. Able to create infinite numbers of fleets (and perhaps naming the fleet) consisting of any amount of ships.

2. Orders.
A. Resupply (auto or not): Have your ships resupply ammo, countermeasures, mines, etc. It works by setting a resupply base for the said ship along with the desired amount of the selected cargo to be resupplied on the particular ship. Example: An Orion gunboat with missile launchers all over, with a Magnus as a supply depot. When ordered to resupply, it will automatically dock at the Magnus and take the amount of the previously set cargo, let's say 25 Interceptors.
B. Auto resupply for stations. Works similary like the 'Resupply' order but in reverse. Example: A Brewery with a ship assigned to supply it with food grains. Once it ran out of said cargo (but still has cargo space available) the ship assigned to resupply it will buy the required resource.
I think it's best for this order to come with a ratio selector for stations that uses more than one commodity to produce another. Example: X_nanochips + X_alloys = X_plasma rifle. The supply ship will only supply the station according to the desired ratio. Meaning, if the station has 10a and 13b and it has a manufacture ratio of 2a : 3b = 5c, the supplying ship will only add 2b even though it has more, which will increase the station's inventory to 10a and 15b, thus conforming to said ratio. To make it less complicated, set the supply ships to resupply after the station has exhausted all its resources.
C. Upgrade. Order a ship to upgrade its components to a specific setting. You don't really need it if you only have one ship. But if you own 10 Haulers and want to buy equip a cloak for each one of them and you have to do it one by one, it gets tiresome and inconvenient.

3. Improved fleet settings. I have a Magnus and 3 Thunders docked in. They're set to 'prefer cloak' but when I order them to attack something, they just roam around near the target without doing anything, same with 'prefer dock' turned on.

4. Building mode. You can place stations at a specific location in the sector you are in. It makes your stations tidy, (I like to keep things tidy) especially when setting up laser perimeters. You can also move around already built stations in that sector.

5. Select ship. Select all, or some of your ships to execute an orde and alter fleet settings, including those in my suggestion. Example: You have 15 Orions and you want to turn them into gunboats, so you select all 15 and order them to 'upgrade' (swap, really) their turrets to have military launchers. Doing it one by one will be inconvenient. Example 2: You have 15 Haulers and you order them to trade while also turning off 'intercept hostiles' option in their fleet settings while also turning on 'prefer cloak' option.

6. Hauler M fix. The second mining turret won't work when the Hauler M is ordered to mine.

Well, this is what came up in my mind while playing. I hope it could be implemented to the game and create a positive impact to all other players. Thank for you creating such a great game. I've rated the game 5 star on Google Play, BTW. I hope it helps.",2020-07-11 03:58:54,19,0,0.9946,1,1,1.0

8105,InterstellarPilots,"Finally updates after all these years!!

II've had some ideas over the years, and i literally can't supress my excitement that this game is getting updates again. These ideas of mine were

Station upgrades
Weapon upgrades (stats boost to existing weapons aside from just changing the weapon altogether)
Alien factions (invaders sort of)
Create ""custom role"" (more like preset instructions macro shortcut""

I just found this reddit sub so these ideas are probably suggested already, but here goes. 

Right now as you go on you end up building more and more stations, and at some point it just ends up as either a cluster that ships get stuck in or you're stuck having to place defenses on multiple clusters, this adding even more clutter, or build stations waaaaayy too far from each other. 

Station upgrades will probably solve this problem, with levels 1-5
Assuming a station that costs 1M credits
Lvl1 is base station

Lvl2 has 2x  Production (+ some stats upgrade but not 2x HP and shield for ""balance"" ) and costs (base price+ 10%) to upgrade, hence 1.1M

Lvl 3 has 3x production and some stat bonuses, for upgrade cost of 1.21M.

Lvl4 at 4x P, for upgrade cost of 1.331M

Lvl5 at 5x P, costing 1.4641M to upgrade.

Upgrade cost is +10% of preceeding level

Costs will probably be adjusted for balance, this just gives an idea.

As for balance and logic, it will probably be better to get at most lvl2 stations for the early game, only upgrading to higher levels later. Partly because it will cost more and partly because the station hp and shield doesn't scale the same as the production and capacity increase, so you need to have dedicated defense (which costs some more) lest you loose a lot for a single station. Also maybe make npcs more aggressive towards higher level stations

Another idea i have is the ""create custom role"", where you can save presets that contains orders, and behaviors, say ""trader passive"", agression at zero, aleays cloak, never engage and trade. Its a minor convenience, but over time it will add up to a lot especially when the credits go flooding in. 

As for alien faction, maybe make it so that they ""cross over"" to our galaxy using the unstable wormholes in the game, appearing at random sectors, with varying fleet strength everytime, say sometimes just recon forces, sometimes full on invasion fleet. Or two or more factions so some are friendly, some are not. 

Make it so that the aliens have ""special equipment"" that sometimes gets dropped when they are killed. Also you can use the unstable wormhole that the aliens came from to jump onto their sector. You can get trapped there tho, and can only bring 1 ship (along with docked ships)",2022-09-27 08:57:28,15,0,0.9375,1,1,1.0

# The Time of Dying

After conquering Solace and Dymapa 753, bandits rose to biblical levels of power and wealth.  They managed to do this while generally avoiding contact with the TEF, with the exception of the Pindolan War.  Most bandits were refugees from the Sol System facing political persecution, or financially destitute indentured workers from Orbital Farms and Refineries.  They generally were able to escape TEF rule by flying TEF ships in disguise into unchartered sectors and then being hauled off to rebel processing stations.

The Terran Expeditionary Force imposed trade embargoes towards factions  towards Black Sail, local bandit factions, and the Fortuna Rebels, from now known as the Rebel Coalition.   These underdeveloped territories formed into a loose conglomerate of rebel dissenters known as the Fortuna Rebels.  These rebels, along with the bandits, launched a massive surprise attack known as the Shipyard Massacre.  The rebel groups bombed the large shipyards in Gatopea wile Fortuna Rebels boarded and ransacked the stations.  The TEF, with the help of Lambda, responded to these attacks with a massive offensive into Dymapa 753.  This offensive failed, but with horrifying losses on both sides.

The Lambdan Navy lured the Rebel Coalition out of Solace and Dymapa 753.   The ensuing conflict was by far the largest military engagement in the entire universe, with millions of ships on both sides and spanning 5 sectors. The Lambdan Navy held out for just long enough for TEF to meet the battle in the outskirts of Galene and Hellemus, where the most intense fighting occurred. The battle lasted for 5 days in a series of grueling dogfights and ship boardings.  In the end, though, the rebels were the first to dip out of the battle.  As before, appalling casualties on both sides were not replenished for years.  The entire economy of the interstellar universe was in ruins.

*Historians estimate that about 1,771,700 ships were destroyed that day.  The total human death toll numbered approximately 3,000,000.  The average age was 21 years old.*",2021-10-23 18:42:50,15,0,-0.9949,-1,-1,1.0

**Thanks for all the feedback you gave! I'm currently working on more as I type this.**

# The Expansion Period

&#x200B;

Early on, all of the Sol System used Gatopea as an interstellar playground.  There was no limits, no laws, and a wild abundance of incredibly rare materials back on Earth.  At this time in history, this sector was originally an asteroid field, but that was quickly over-mined.   Some small expedition crews were sent to its flagship planet, where raw materials could be easily collected.

Expansion to other sectors became easy.  Androla and Hellemus became the go-to hub for mining and raw resources.  Terekos was the breadbasket of the new frontier.   They discovered a new planetary sector, Galene, which served as a trading post for exotic goods.  Expansion to Beta Pindola was difficult, as primitive bandit factions united to defend the area.  TEF captured them in a massive battle during the Great Pindolan War. Beta Pindola was the secondary major hub of the frontier.

Two new ships were created:  The Shuttle and the Raptor.  The Shuttle immediately outclassed the Ranger as the primary spacecraft, as it was both economical, and can be used for almost everything.  The Raptor was similar to the Shuttle and Ranger but was build with scouting and light combat in mind.

A number of factions were set up, including Lambda Corp, which originally specialized in cross-sector freight.   Al-Ghat was an exotic materials and weapons dealer that settled in Galene.  Nobody really liked them, but they were needed to keep TEF stocked with their navy.

The group of primitive bandits and runaway outlaws united under Black Sail, but were still divided into their own territories.   They generally avoided contact with anyone else, and set up bases in the previously undiscovered Dymapa 753.

After OPERATION CASBAH by Lambda, Solace was discovered, but was almost immediately overrun by bandits.  Solace was used by the bandits to produce arms and equipment, as well as the rallying point of the capitol ships.",2021-10-23 15:54:23,16,0,0.8854,1,1,1.0

# 

In 2230, a group of astronauts were manning a small orbital station, circling around Titan.  This station was a joint project conducted between the United American Federation (Modern USA), and the North African Republic (Modern Egypt).  On routine maintenance calls, they spotted a faint, strange object a few miles away.

&#x200B;

*It glowed a bright green.*

&#x200B;

Scientists had not seen anything like this before, although they knew fairly well that it was a wormhole.  The very thought of this shook civilization to its core.  They knew they had to test it, but were not ready to do it on humans.  They designed a few simple drones that would get in and get out of the wormhole.  These missions were a success, but they returned with high levels of radiation and with odd new chemicals attached to them.

They decided to build a craft with humans inside of it.  For 3 years, they used the best available technologies and every government in the Sol System were cooperating on a common goal.  The day came, and the 2 brave astronauts stepped inside the Vulcan-1.

The leap into the wormhole was only described by the pilots as a green tunnel obscuring your entire vision.  It was eerie and mind numbing.  But, according to them, it was worth it.  They ventured into a whole new galaxy, barraged with a onslaught of new experiences around them, all from the saftey of their own little ship.

&#x200B;

*They didn't see the meteor coming.*

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the radio signals did not make it in time, but the temperature and ionizers shifted dramatically.  They knew there was something on the other side.  These scientists, dedicated to their craft and their respective nations, worked hard to make this new hope possible.

The Vulcan-2 managed to return successfully.  They were anointed as heroes to mankind, and given millions of credits.  Most importantly, they set a basis of knowledge to allow more ships to venture in.

Eventually, a commercial model of the Vulcan-2 was made, now known as the Ranger-A.  Cheap to make and easy to operate, everyone in the Sol System used them.

Over the next few decades, a number of small colonies were made by different nations.  They united themselves under one common name:

&#x200B;

***The Terran Expeditionary Force.***

Wouldve been nice if they make a class that has no shields but the hull integrity is really high, especially the front. The front of the ship is slightly pointed, and has the ability to ""dash"" at a small distance and ""ram"" whatever target is in front of the ship, sacrificing a small percentage of hull integrity and breaking the enemies' shields. Good against stations and battlecruisers. This is one of those ships that are not really necessary but can be beneficial. 

EDIT:  I guess the downside of it (for balancing purposes) is it has no weapons and docking bays? The ships needs to be protected if you want to use it. 

EDIT2: I just realized it's like creon but doesnt really rely on shields as defence. I feel like it's more of a ""suicide"" ship? idk :V But it can be used for trading but not really recommended since it has no weapons so its basically sitting duck",2019-10-03 14:49:38,15,0,0.9611,1,1,1.0

So the top bounty by my neighbor superpower is  Chief. Michelle Thompson of the Gorkiv bandits for 56,000. The ship in question, a Magnus A by the name of ""Herald"", was last seen 142 days ago according to the bounty board.

 The location it was last reported at is well within my territory, the Gorkiv bandits are a resigned faction, and all of those sectors are considered 'core' sectors and have a very secure security status, with the worst attacks I get being the occasional bounty hunter in a Thunder class. Well I ordered a ship there to investigate, turns out the Herald is there. Just sitting there. No fighter escort, no station, no other ships, just a Magnus A+ class warship floating in space, well off the primary trade routes.

8137,InterstellarPilots,"VOL. 5 | THE ARMS RACE

The massive economic boom brought forth by the ITP called for the creation of newer, stronger ships to protect these vital trade routes.  Lambda, incredibly reliant on trade, developed a new solution to this problem, : **The Hornet.** The hornet was as quick as lightning,  and was cheap to produce.  An instant hit, it was used by criminals, cops, and citizens alike.   The X-Variant was developed by ADR Technologies, who were known for their civilian models and their experimentation with cloaks and radar jammers. 

TEF snapped back quickly with their personally developed, militarized **Flyer.**  Slower but stronger, it could easily disarm most ships in the universe.  It was co-produced by CLL Systems under their propaganda of Lambda hostilities.  Lambda made tTeheir own copies under ADR. 

Lambda was also working on a secret project, **The Magnus**. Although powerful, it was not a primary combat ship, but rather a mobile base and projection of force.  However, a bandit raid under the command of Keno Duerr stole a prototype and returned it to Black Sail.  Even after this, the Magnus began small scale production. 

TEF, after receiving news of this threat, (And propaganda from ADR), began work on the **Overlord** and **Ares.**  Incredibly powerful and highly useful, these were a mainstay of TEF for a long period of time.  

Lambda, with an even bigger need for trade, developed the **Orion** and **Creon**.  Designed for large scale trade across long distances, they were vital for the sustenance of Lambda's thirst for even more goods. 

TEF, rising to the occasion again, quietly began work on a new ship, **The Thunder**. Acting as both a frigate and interceptor, it could be used for both trade and conquest, and competed quite nicely against the Orion and Creon. 

This deathless war would continue for quite a while as both developed increasingly advanced military equipment.",2021-10-25 23:22:41,14,0,0.9075,1,1,1.0

8139,InterstellarPilots,"How to steal a Capital ship !!

I don't know if you guys already know about this or not, but here we go, you can steal a Capital ship(namely the Magnus and the Overlord)

First: max out your relationship with the faction who owns the ship, or enough so they allow you to dock in their Capital ships(preferably capital ships actively trading )

2nd: dock in their Capital ship after checking it's orders,  if it's trading or going back to base or repairing,  dock quickly before the capital ship docks in a station, then immediately undock from your own ship while inside the Capital ship, but stay in the capital ship, wait for it to dock in a station.

3rd: once the capital ship leaves the station on its own, it becomes yours, just like that, but make sure to cancel its current orders, and immediately change the ship's name(very important) and assign it to a fleet and give it orders to dock in your station or anywhere else, best if you sell it, you'll make around 980k-1.1M credits, and even better if you have a mission to deliver that very ship.

Hope it helps, I already make millions even before I even own any Station or turret,  Also best used in a custom universe, since they trade with Magnus class battleships for some reason.",2021-03-16 03:14:06,14,0,0.9866,1,1,1.0

Hi guys, 

Right now I have about 33 million credits, so I decided to try my luck with a refinery. I bought the parts, and deployed it in the dagola sector (type-b asteroids). I also purchased 4 hauler-m mining vessels and equipped them with advanced mining lasers. I am aware that it'd be best if I supply the raw materials myself. So the problem is, there are 2 other refineries in the sector, and my ships are selling the ore to the other refineries instead of transferring it over to mine. How am I supposed to go about this. Should I attempt to destroy the other 2 refineries, which may have potentially damaging implications? Or should I just ignore this? Thanks",2020-09-09 02:58:45,13,0,0.4865,1,1,1.0

Ares and Magnus no longer look good... Ares just looks like a big Ranger, and Magnus went from being the most terrifying space ship to a derpy-looking boi... but granted Magnus is a derp-gun, emphasis on derp

Meanwhile the Overlord's new design has me head-over-heels every time to finally acquire it in game, and i enjoy flying the Flyers because they look pretty good, and i always have at least one Ranger or Pioneer in my owned ships because i love their designs

i would love to (for shits and giggles) see a passenger-dedicated spaceship which looks like an RMS Titanic or RMS Lusitania ocean-liner but for space, like where the Titanic version is big, so carries a lot, but is slower, while the Lusitania one is faster, but doesn't carry as much, and both have provisions for mines, countermeasures, and some weapons for defense against pirates/bandits",2023-08-06 06:57:42,11,0,0.9891,1,1,1.0

# ECONOMIC BOOM

After the horrific ordeals of the war,  Rebel Collective grew to be scared of outside contact and instated a period of severe xenophobia.  They shut themselves off from the rest of the world yet struggled to build a self sufficient system, forcing them to go back to raiding refineries and shipyards for the very little scraps they could get their hands on.  They were just as powerful, yet were failing to grow at all, causing mass migrations toward neutral independent factions, which eventually spit up the Rebel Collective into a loose group of bitter trade partners.  The Rebel Collective owned a trade station in Rebel-controlled Terekos (known as the Laharan Republic), however that was destroyed in a testing range accident. 

The mining and trading sectors benefitted for the sudden demand, and experiences experienced an economic boom like nothing else.  NewHaven, DSMC, New World Mining, and Bluestar created the Intergalactic Trade Pact, which controlled 60% of all trade through various sectors.  New ships such as the Venture, Pioneer, and Hauler greatly contributed to the average miner and merchant's life. 

On the shadier side of things, Al-Ghat was mass producing Impulse, a recreational and military drug made to enhance worker performance and the mental acuity of Fighter Pilots.  A cheap, easy to get commodity, it caused several legal problems and was outlawed by the TEF.  Due to Al-Ghat's ties to the professional smugglers in Dymapa 753, and the dwindling supply of Galene materials to use,  they were able to produce it in the hands of smugglers with homegrown Dymapa-753 materials.  However, when most of the Impulse was siezed by TEF enforcers, these outlaws fiercely protected and hid their dwindling supply of the drug.",2021-10-25 22:45:27,12,0,-0.9756,-1,-1,1.0
8209,InterstellarPilots,"Mining Issues

Hey guys,

I have been playing in Universe 2, a wormhole too far, and I have amassed about 5 million credits. My main base of operations is at Beta Pindola, and I have established all the stations except for the refinery and the orbital farm. Now here comes the issue. There is a severe lack of nanochips. All the refineries in the universe have no nanochips in their cargo bay. This would mean that any product that requires nanochips cannot be produced (medipacks, hoverbikes, hypersleep pods and plasma rifles). This causes all trade to grind to a halt. So I was thinking, it could be because there was a lack of copper ore. However, all mining ships, including my own, are filled with ore, but cannot find a place to sell them. This may be a possible glitch, because I can manually sell the ore at any refinery, but on autopilot, the ships just cannot seem to be able to sell them. I was hoping you guys have an answer to this. Thanks!

8210,InterstellarPilots,"Controlling station buy and sell prices?

In my universe, there are three hover bike suppliers. First one is in Dymapa, and it is still crawling with Black Sail activity, so most traders avoid that one. Second one belongs to TEF, which went destitute a while ago and cannot buy any materials to produce more hover bikes, therefore it is never able to supply anything. And the third hover bike supplier belongs to me, I have plenty of supply, Galene and Beta Pindola trade stations demand the bikes, yet no one trades with my vehicle factory.

On top of that, no matter how much hover bike stock I build up, my vehicle factory always stays the most expensive option to buy from. Even the TEF one with absolutely no supply appears to be preferred over my factory. I hope getting a trade station of my own will remedy this issue somewhat, but maybe there could be a way to manipulate and reduce the selling price of the hover bikes in my factory, so that traders would prefer to buy from me?",2020-09-19 18:54:14,12,0,-0.3642,-1,-1,1.0

Hi guys, 

I have a couple of questions regarding stations. 

Firstly, how do my stations obtain supplies? My guess is that other NPC traders come to my stations and sell the required materials to my station for production.

Secondly, I have noticed that there are insufficient NPCs who come to my stations to supply them with goods to produce, fewer than those who come to my station to buy the product (eg. not enough food grains to produce pindolan ale). As such, I want to build my own orbital farms etc to supply my own stations. When the, say for example, grains are ready, do they automatically transfer to the brewery for production, or do I have to do it manually?

Thirdly, if I have to transfer manually, is it possible to transfer it using autopilot?

Fourthly, how can I ensure that I have a continuous supply of the required goods, because I am losing a lot of buyers?

8278,InterstellarPilots,"A nightmare of a battle

So after ""acquiring""(stealing) Magnuses from npc factionand and selling them, I looked around for a pirate stations to exterminate.I found an isolated station with three laser III and one laser V turrets.
After some scouting with a cloaked hornet, I found out four fighters that, after decloacking, bait them into the rest of my fleet: a magnus-a, two flyer-a and two thunder-a. Happy with the situation, I got back at the helm of my magnus, and this is where think start going bad. My hornet-x is destroyed in the opening salvo of the battle, surprised and concerned I take a look at the sector map and there is not four, not five nor seven... but a dozen fighters.

I immediately start firing my guns at them but after missiles and mines exploding all around me, my shield take some damages, but are still holding. The same happens to my fighters but some of their shields are nearly downs and one of the thunder got some hull damages. Trying to resolve the shields problem I start salvaging the battlefield, waiting for my shield to recharge, but the pirate weren't done yet they started sending small waves of fighter, not enough to do real damage but enough to make my shield recharge impossible.

And then I make my second error, I trusted the autopilot which following is programming started not to head back to my base but decided to engage the turrets... at very close range. Before I can react, one of the three laser III turrets is dead, grabbing the opportunity is redirected the shots towards the laser V turret and started throwing everything I had. Salvo after salvo of laser and rockets bring the turret down and started heading back to my base myself, but not before another wave of fighter got send my way. Those fighter broke my shield and begins firing directly into the hull.
I went away sure of myself and get back the with my tail between my legs, but I will come back stronger and this time will grab victory from my enemy.

8292,InterstellarPilots,"Autopilot Ship Buying Guide

There's a lot of ships in the game, and when buying a ship for an autopilot task, you may wonder which ones are better for which task. Part of this depends on how you play the game. There's three basic styles of play, and each favors a different build. 

#Everyone is Hostile

So you've managed to make most of the factions Hostile? Don't worry, you can still have ships on Autopilot without worrying *too* much about them all getting blown up. The idea here is to make sure your ships are tough and heavily armed, to withstand attacks. You'll also want to provide escorts. Your merchant and passenger ships should be set to Attack, but not Intercept, hostiles, with a moderate Aggression. Miners should Attack and Intercept, with moderate Aggression, and escorts should Attack and Intercept with high Aggression.

**Trading**

If everyone hates you, who are you trading with? To keep your merchant fleet from getting blown up, use fully upgraded Creon-As. Missile payloads will diminish your trade capacity, so stick to low energy use weapons, such as lasers. You'll also be fending off small fighters much more often than cruisers or battleships, which you can outrun. Put photon weapons on your broadside and maybe one plasma weapon firing aft. A Creon's top speed is nearly 40, so escort with Pioneers instead of Flyers, so that the escort fleet can keep up. As an added bonus, the Pioneers can carry the missile payload that the merchant isn't. 

**Mining**

This is similar to Trading, with the caveat that your miners tend to stay in one place. Use the same build as your merchant fleet (with the addition of an Advanced Mining Laser, of course.) Escort them with Flyers, and build laser turrets in asteroid fields for added protection. 

#Taking Sides 

You've either pissed off the bad guys (bandits, rebels, and pirates) by working for the good guys (TEF, Lambda, Al-Ghat, DSMC, NWM) or vise versa. In some areas, your ships are relatively safe, while in others - not so much. One useful strategy to use is Interdiction: Assign a capital ship or a fleet of fighters to Protect your side of a wormhole leading to hostile space. Make sure to set them to Attack, Intercept, and max Aggression. This will stop random enemy patrols. Build Laser Turrets around allies' stations, to provide safe spaces for your merchants to run to.

**Trading**

Use the same strategy as given for Everyone Hates You, above, with the following changes: Using the Faction Options, ban your ships from trading in sectors hostile to you: and you may not need to spend money on escorts. Speed and defense is more important than firepower, so upgrade your shields and engines first - your ship can outrun enemies, and will lead them into safe spaces where they'll be outnumbered.

**Mining** 

You'll definitely want to limit your mining ships to one sector or another, to prevent them from wandering into hostile space. Set their base as a friendly Refinery, then limit them to 0 jumps. Caution- if you assign too many miners to a refinery, it'll get too full.

#The Switzerland Strategy 

So you've decided to be neutral to everyone, and no one wants to kill you? Then you have the biggest strategy change v instead of going for tough, heavily armed ships, you want fast ships.

**Trading**

The bane of every merchant is arriving too late with a cargo, and having to wait to sell it - or only being able to sell part of it. To avoid this, use Pioneers for merchants. They only carry 40, but they're faster than any other ship with a cargo hold, and you can buy more of them. 

**Mining**

Here, you want to go completely off the rails. The idea is to carry the largest cargo possible, and weapons don't matter: instead of using the Hauler-M, use the Hauler-H. The extra cargo space more than makes up for the missing weapon. The Creon still carries more cargo, so if you're willing to spend the cash, they're good too.



#Passenger Fares

There's no circumstance except extreme poverty where any ship besides a Pioneer-P with max engines is good for this role. The only comparable ship, the Hauler-P, may be sturdier, but it's slow and doesn't carry as many passengers. Nothing can catch Pioneers except Hornets, so if you're worried about them, use Hornets as escorts. Since they're not using their cargo hold, they can carry a good load of missiles as well.

(this is in IP 2)

Playing in a very large sandbox, so what im guessing happened is the sandbox generated weirdly and none of the core sectors really connected, in this one lambda was consistently being very aggressive and expansionist and kept declaring war on factions that were on the other side of the map, 12-14 jumps. So they never launched any ships because the target sector was to far away... so the ships just kept building up in numbers.

Fortunately, I was in a roleplaying mood and was playing along with my neighbor faction who happened to hate lambda with its heart and soul. So it declares war and I also declare war on lambda. I send my primary fleet to wipe out lambda just for the fun of it, and what do ya know? Game lags like all hell when I enter Lambdas home sector, then immediately crashes as soon as I start attacking the enemy fleet. 

Fortunately I had a save before entering the sector so I booted that up, cloaked my fleet and dismantled my entire trade force, before re entering the sector and removing lambda from existence. Pretty sure my fleet shot down like 200 fighters and (i

P.S. I know I might sound stupid, but I'm challenging myself to only use small ships in the game, no frigates, and definitely no capital ships 'cause I'm poor :D

Also, my faction is just 3 real life days old. Aptly named; ""Renzorps Inc.""

And yes, this is Interstellar Pilot 1.

ANYWAY, MY ARMY CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:
> Main Army
- 8 Flyer A (that includes me since I lead the group, no fleets assigned)

> Interceptors (decoys)
- 18 Raptor A (6 per fleet, all laser turrets)

> Reinforcement
- 6 Flyer X (just in case, all in one fleet)

HOW I USE IT
- I use my main army as sort of a patrol group to look out for any baddies lurking with in and out of my sector, especially I watch out for any distress calls.
- When raiding a station, I start out by making my ""interceptors"" go in as the frontline to see if there's enemy ships guarding that station, they could also inflict some primary damage since usually they outnumber my enemies. Unsurprisingly, some of them die in the process which is fine, because I could always buy some replacement provided I have economy income in the game. Seldomly, all of my ""interceptors"" could also get wiped out.
- Next, if the plan is successful, no wiping out happens, I would engage with my main group together with my ship and proceed to massacre their station to oblivion.
- As for my backups, they are just there to reinforce my group just in case my raptors get wiped out, and we are forced to fight since we are in the middle of the battlefield, enemy missiles locked on to everyone, I would order them to come as a last resort to kill my enemies. On the same occasion as my raptors are wiped out, one of my group died down since we are forced to stay in the fight for the enemies are locking down on us, F.",2022-10-09 13:01:20,10,0,-0.9962,-1,-1,1.0

I've played interstellar pilot for quite a while. However one thing that always irked me was the Black sail outpost: It always maxes out it's cargo space on junk. It'll be filled with missiles and mines picked up by scavengers, then once it reaches it's limit, the scavengers sit in it's hangar bay indefinitely. This wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that it acts as a refinery, meaning once it's filled up, my miners go and wait there as well, inside or outside. I would really like to see an extremely powerful black sail faction, and using it's refineries to fund the bandit faction. (As well as fortuna but that's different.

The only solution I've ever come up with is destroying the outpost. It's not all that risky if you don't have infrastructure yet in Dymapa, but it's infuriating I have to go out of my way to solve the problem.

And to clear up any ideas people may have, I have already tried filling up it's hangar bay BEFORE it maxes out. Ships still wait outside.

Hey Y‚Äôall! Joined the sub today. Huge fan of the game, IP2 has so many cool features.

Scrolling through the sub, I enjoy a lot of the folks saying that they‚Äôd like to see the devs use much more of the game assets. They got me thinking‚Ä¶

What if the tractor beams were given an additional function to be able to pull wormholes, and cause either cataclysmic system end or temporal reality shift? In the case of the reality shift, rename stations, change the control of the sector from allies to enemies etc.?

about the physics of that, I just have questions. is it a matter of ship speed? Speed over 40 or 50; is it a matter of ship acceleration while latched onto wormhole?

Some kind of repair ship for long missions
Capital Warship (maybe not bought from a shipyard, but instead built like a station)
Bombers (strong turret but limited firing angle, not as manoeuvrable as fighters)
Station ideas:
Residential stations (kinda budget trade station for non planet sectors, buys food and water and generates credits)
Heavy weapons platform (no elaboration needed)
Defensive strongholds (station with large hangar, repair, good defence and a ship shop with frigates)
Weapons ideas:
Higher tier sentinel turrets
Tier V variant for all weapons
Make the artillery actually good, or some high tier artillery, it‚Äôs in a really weird spot

8390,InterstellarPilots,"Interstellar Pilot 1: Energy Weapons ADJUSTMENTS! (version 1.6.7)

This article will contain all\* information regarding the current adjustments made to the energy weapons in the 1.6.7 update. All energy weapons received some adjustments regarding their ""efficiency"". Hope this will help you dear pilots, especially for those who are curious regarding as to how much damage they will now have.

\*In case I missed something, additions are welcome to the comments down below, thanks.

# Lasers

Sadly, the update done to lasers is no good. All variants now have the same efficiency amount (I guess pixelfactor should change the description of Laser I then). They still have same energy costs for all variants. Though, don't get yourselves comfortable because of the lower efficiency, its damage output will be severly hindered. (I'll explain later)

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|IV|V|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|1,000 Cr|4,500 Cr|23,000 Cr|56,000 Cr|112,500 Cr|
|Energy Cost|101.2|135|202.5|295.3|421.9|
|Efficiency|0.9 (1.3)|0.9 (1.2)|0.9 (1)|0.9 (0.95)|0.9 (0.95)|
|Damage (Full Charge)|91.08 (131.56)|121.5 (162)|182.25 (202.5)|265.77 (280.535)|379.71 (400.805)|
|Charge Time (seconds)|7.5|7.5|8|9|9|
|Range|250|300|300|375|550|

# Plasma Pulse

Good news, pixelfactor finally paid attention to this sluggish yet lethal weapon (high risk, high reward). All variants got an increased efficiency, while still keeping the same energy cost.

() indicates the stats prior to the latest version

|Variants|I|II|III|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price (Average)|2,750 Cr|9,000|29,000|

|Range|300|350|475|
|Speed|150|125|100|

# Photon Burst

Last but not least, the photon burst also received some adjustments regarding its efficiency. Fortunately, it also relates to the Plasma Pulse in terms of the said adjustments.

|Variants|I|II|III|

# Finding the actual damage of the weapons

Actually, the game does not provide a clear statement as to what the damage of your weapon is supposed to be. Luckily, efficiency is provided alongside the energy cost. To do this, assuming the efficiency is RELATED to the ""energy cost-damage ratio"" of the weapon, just MULTIPLY the energy cost with efficiency and you will get the weapon's damage.

**REMEMBER: Less efficiency means more amount for the ""energy cost"" compared to the ""damage"" of a weapon, hence the nerf of the laser's efficiency significantly hindered its damage output as you can see from the stats above. While more efficiency means more amount for the ""damage"" compared to the ""energy cost"" of the said weapon such as of the Plasma Pulse and Photon Burst.**

For example, a laser II's energy cost is 135 units, with an efficiency of 0.9, applying the formula for ""finding the actual damage of the weapons"", this means that it has a damage of 121.5 units in the current version. As for the prior version, it has an efficiency of 1.2, meaning it should deal 162 units of damage in its weaponry.

Another is for the Photon Burst I, it has an energy cost of 135 units as well, though with an efficiency of 1.1. Applying the formula as to how to solve for the damage of the weapon, we get 148.5 units worth of damage. In the prior version, with an efficiency of exactly ""1"", we get the same damage as with its energy cost which is 135 units, lol.

So logically, THE FIRST LEVEL of the Photon Burst is better than THE SECOND LEVEL of the Laser in regards to those examples. I hope you learned something, and thank you for reading! Have a great day pilot :D",2022-11-14 08:36:56,8,0,0.9598,1,1,1.0

8410,InterstellarPilots,"Useful strategies

A few useful strategies to make things easier for you:

1- use ships with a cloaking device(electronics bay) for npc trade and passenger runs to avoid losing them to bounty hunters and hostiles(so far, not a viable tactic with npc mining)

2- use ships with lower cargo capacities to have npcs avoid station gridlock easier(npcs want to sell their full load at one time; problematic if a station won't buy that much)

3- use a cloaking ship for attack missions(get behind the target while cloaked, decloak, fire full volley, recloak, recharge, repeat)

4- use fleet orders(button at bottom right of orders) to set aggression on npc ships to minimum(to the left), so they trade a larger variety of items(to avoid gridlock); also use fleet orders to set auto use for cloaking, or to flee to station automatically

BTW, the flyer is good for cloaked trading; the pioneer is good for cloaked passenger hauling;
Edit:the flyer is good due to max upgrade speed(64), and low-moderate cargo(30); the hornet is also good at up to 80 speed, and 20 cargo, but neither can have passengers

I plan to update this over time, so any strategies you find would be appreciated, and edited into this post(with origin credit); feel free to suggest strategies in comments, or via messages.",2017-02-08 01:56:20,7,0,0.9267,1,1,1.0

So first of all i understand that to improve relation i do thier missions/jobs and don't attack thier ships. But one time i accidentally attacked a faction but i quickly paid it off when it was only some credits. 
The thing i didn't realised is that after a while they broke the truce and attacked my ships in another sector. I thought it was some bandits (I didn't look at the inbox notificatiosns) so my ship repelled and destroyed them and the relation only got worse but i paid it off after some days when i saw they were attacking my station.
But they again broke the truce and i had to destroy their whole fleet and a station because although i paid for the truce they still attacked and so did my ships and truce broke.
After killing them all i again made truce but saw that it was some 700k credits but still paid it off and they were on red relation. Although i never attacked them they continued to break the truce and i can't pay 700k every single time. And now I can't even do thier missions to increase relation. I don't want to kill every single one of them (i can't) and i had earlier good trade routes going through thier sectors and war doesn't allow me to trade with farway sectors which i am dependent on for credits.

Every time I encounter a rival faction there's like four of them firing missiles. I can't get any bonus because I'm swarmed, tried making a delivery and I got swarmed. No credits to get my ship repaired, so I just keep getting clobbered.

Now I'm not playing it to set up a fleet or anything. I just like flying around and getting into skirmishes, delivering goods and collecting bounties. Maybe this version isn't designed for the extremely casual player?",2023-10-20 21:57:34,6,0,0.2917,1,1,1.0

8435,InterstellarPilots,"A suggestion to help lower spec systems

Hello again everyone,

Once I start to control about 1/4 or so of a 64-sector game, my computer starts to take 2+ minutes to find a trade route for any one fleet. It appears that the way the game calculates those routes can backlog in order to keep the frame rate up, which is a great thing as it can catch up when less fleets are finishing their runs, and queue when more fleets have recently finished a run.

However, for lower-spec systems in never catches up. 

I was wondering, is there any way to modify the code to allow the computer to catch up while the game is paused?

I often pause to check my maps when bandits pop up in several systems at once or to upgrade multiple buildings that just finished. However, that appears to pause all background computing as well, including trade route selection. 

Does anyone know if the idea is feasible, to allow those calculations to keep going while paused?",2023-08-31 23:18:16,6,0,0.8708,1,1,1.0
8436,InterstellarPilots,"Trade glitching

For some reason, half of my trade vessels have begun sticking in 0%, no matter how many times I clear orders, dismantle ships and buy new, reload the game, etc. A large portion of my fleet simply can't find trade routes. Even buying them at refineries with loads of materials to move, they're within arms reach of 100s of resources, and can't find a route.

8437,InterstellarPilots,"Ships uncloaking automatically?

Why does the cloaking mechanism of Interstellar Pilot 2 automatically uncloacks ships when they take damage while they are on the process of cloacking? I've only observed this on Small Cloak devices, no matter what level it is, it still happens. I find it devastating when I'm on a fight and suddenly, the enemy decided to target lock and surround me, I pop it my level 4 version of the small cloak device that also has 50% damage reduction while cloaking/uncloaking in hopes of switching their targets on one of my other ships but as I do so, with their weapons still firing at me, my ship automatically uncloaks itself while playing the uncloak sound in the process, my hull health is now down to orange much faster than if I haven't cloak in the first place. Anyone else experience this? I don't know if it is the same case on the cloaks used for capital ships as I don't typically equip them with one.

The 1st game of Interstellar Pilot does not do this as far as I can tell. Don't get me started on detectable cloaked ships as long as you are within 250 units from them or so. Is the nerf of the cloaking system on this 2nd game that bad? State your opinion as well in the comments down below.

4 - My asteroid sector setup. Just a refinery. But on top of that, I have 4 miners (each guarded by 2 magnuses) per asteroid sector (29 asteroid sectors).

5 - Full navy. 384 magnuses, 192 hornets, 128 ares, and 96 thunders.

6 - The 3 sectors i use to store my navy (would get too laggy in one). Fort C stores the carrier fleets (8 magnuses with assorted laser v + sentinel, 12 hornets, 6 thunders).

So I've been playing interstellar pilot off and on for quite a while now (maybe 5-6 years?). Played IP1 on android and loved it. Got IP2 on android the day it came out and appreciated the changes. Had been waiting/hoping for a Linux specific (pc) version in one form or another pretty much since I first played it. Had never tried anything steam before, but found out they've got some emulation (or something) that makes it possible to play things on a Linux box that weren't written for Linux. So I tried it, and it works great (with void Linux. Probably other distros, too). It's FANTASTIC on a desktop. Even a not very high end desktop. Currently using a Lenovo m900 tiny with an i5-6600t and 8GB ram without any problems.

It could use more complete keybinds, or even better would be user definable keybinds (fire control, scanner access). What's there works, though. ",2023-07-04 08:39:28,7,0,0.9818,1,1,1.0

Hello, I'm back for some more advice after my previous post on the Lambda base spawning pirates in my home sector. Thank you guys for your input, those strategies worked quite well... Until I decided it was high time to start my actual conquest and blew the station up. I've also now taken their home planet, and destroyed all of their structures and capital ships. My question relates to the factions screen; they are still rated higher than me as a superpower, despite having no real assets. Could I be missing a planet? Is this a known issue? I'd just like to be rid of them. Thanks again.

The GunStar is purely offensive. Player should be in the driver seat. Lots of reloading. On the plus side, this vessel is a nightmare for the enemy. I've actually had the game stop playing against me twice while engaging with this craft. 

The Outlander is a fantastic defense craft. It's great for defending high value property, never needs rearming and is fun to take into combat. Her armament allows her to face a variety of threats and she's more than competent in offensive engagements.

The Meteor is one of my newest vessels. She just kinda ""happened"" one day. You'll notice the laser IV configuration. This actually increases her rate of fire. The mil spec launcher with Interceptor missiles gives her added reach and punch while the Photn Burst III dishes out pain to enemy fighters.

This will be my opinion on changes in 1.6.0 that I already know.

1. Mining Laser
   You can't buy Mining Laser and Adv. Mining Laser anymore (or they just changed the buying shop, it was on Refinery before). This is bad for me. Hauler-H miner is actually really good.

2. Interface Layout
   The cargo trade and equipment screen is much neater and easier to navigate. Pretty good especially if you have something specific to buy and don't want to waste time pressing arrow buttons to look at every cargo.

3. Mercenary AI
   A nice addition, helps for station attacks. Pretty cheap too. Only if there were more of them.

4. Autopilot Orders
   The ""Repair to Nearest"" order is a nice touch. It saves time. Maybe next update dev should add Scavenge, Patrol and Explore commands.

5. Friend Bar Glitch
   This is a glitch (I think it isn't meant to be added) that I found where the Friendliness meter exceeds the maximum. This actually is a big help, since they give REALLY GOOD prices. There's one station where every equipment upgrade costs 0 Credits. One of the Shipyards sells Arms Factory parts for 200 thousand Cr, and buys them back for 2 million Cr.

I died and did retry maybe 3 times within the process and did the same with the Phoenix faction.  Also, it was fun as hell!

8559,InterstellarPilots,"Can Factions Be Destroyed?

Short answer: sort of.

Long answer: Not completely. In my war with the bandits, I discovered that any station destroyed simply respawned when I wasn't looking, sending me on a never ending cycle of blowing up outposts and the occasional laser turret.

Then I dropped three laser turrets on the site where they rebuild. I did this every time I killed an outpost.

They can't rebuild, because as long as they're tagged Hostile, my turrets will open fire before their construction reaches 1%. They've dropped to the bottom of the faction list, and since outposts spawn fighters, I think we've seen the last of them.

Next I'll take on Black Sail. We'll see how this works with a larger faction. I'm concerned about blowing up trade stations, though - they're the only market for finished goods, and players can't build their own.

Edit: Bandit ships will respawn from Fortuna and Black Sail bases. I've now dropped turrets next to them as well. As an added bonus, this will give me a nice sneak attack when I go to war with them.",2016-11-24 20:16:46,5,0,-0.9621,-1,-1,1.0

Noticed the ships died in the glitched fleet (engine no work, can't turn, don't take orders, etc.) Luckily it wasn't that far back so I loaded an earlier save.

Also, I think the way you do the glitch may be to assign a bunch of ships to the fleet at once cause when ships are doing the ""join fleet"" task they technically aren't part of the fleet yet so you can make multiple ships join the fleet before the fleet number updates.

8579,InterstellarPilots,"Your favorite variants

Hey everyone, I am curious as to what your favorite variants are to use in various situations.

I use a lot of mid-level overlords with bursters. I find that the burster's balance of moderate chance to hit with mid-level efficiency gives it overall utility against a variety of enemies. Usually, I put one Overlord-A with all proton burst III and a 120 generator in a fleet with 7 Flyer-A armed with all Proton Burst I. Since they are typically chasing the enemy their proton shots seem to be a lot more accurate against small enemies than the overlord, so once I can afford it I switch to a laser build on the overload-A. 

Late game, I tend to make fleets of:

1 - Magnus-A with three wide arc laser V and the rest of the smaller angle turrets equipped with laser III or IV, with two Anti-missiles on its two 360-degree turret slots. 

2 - Overlord-A with wide-angle laser V and the more narrow-angle turrets at laser III or IV. The rear turrets have laser III.

2 - Creon-A with proton burst III on wide angle and Plasma III on narrow-angle slots. Since these can only have weaker generators, capped at 52, I try to only use the more energy-efficient weapons on them.

3 - Ares-A with complete photon burst builds.

Since the Ares seem to work a lot better than the Creons, I've been tempted to go with 5 Areas and completely stop using the Creons outside of Currier missions.

Moments ago, I get a mail stating that a property of mine is being attacked. It was a Hauler-M, mining some asteroids (as you can see from the variant) with an escort Flyer-X beside it under the ""Protect"" order in Terekos sector. So that ship is being attacked by a bounty hunter using an Ares so I jumped on to the ship protecting my Hauler, turns out, it just remained cloaked like having an objection to its intended job :D

I tried checking in the order settings and I have ""attack hostiles"" and ""intercept hostiles"" on with the aggression meter set at the middle, and with the prefer cloak option turned on obviously. That Flyer-X of mine refuse to do what it's supposed to do so I did a manual human intervention and attacked the bounter hunter myself, luckily I'd succeeded. My Hauler only suffered severe shield damage, fortunately no hull damage :D

But imagine, what if your main set of ships are battling something while your mining ships get attacked and their escorts refuse to protect them. Guess, I gotta make a hard decision into letting the AI controlling my main ship that I was using, and as you know because of the bug maybe my main ship will have the same issue as well. So back to the last paragraph, I also tried troubleshooting the problem by stopping the order set on my Flyer and setting its order to protect my Hauler yet again, this time it is now fixed when another bounty hunter attacked my Hauler again (well, hopefully)

Yes my tactic is a bit of exotic but it works all the time.

3. With a small raiding fleet and a small economy fleet you can star to militarise your faction. I buy usually 2 or 3 Overlords.

‚Ä¢ New weapons, notably for smaller ships, as they tend to get outgunned easily even against their equals if energy isn't managed right.

‚Ä¢ Energy focus! Being able to redirect energy flow into certain components, mostly shield directions, engines, and weapons.

‚Ä¢ Adding the Comms system from Scenarios into Universe, to help make the game more alive. This could also lead to hiring wingmen, as seen in the first scenario, or even bargaining with enemies to keep them from blowing your ship to dust.

‚Ä¢ 'Magnus-F' flagship class, housing 10 docking bays of Frigate or below, has 'small' weaponry purchasable inside (Frigate and below), and has Repair Facilities. To balance things out, it could lack shields, instead having a 10 second 'Flagship' cloaking device, prompting a more defensive usage.

8668,InterstellarPilots,"IP Review

Hi!  :) I'm just giving a review, mostly for the purposes of the designer ;)


IP  is probably one of the best mobile platform space trader Sims out there. Having played things like space traders, into the void, and alite, this game stands on top as the most seamless and immersing experience in my eyes. The game is also well priced, with a small purchase needed to unlock late game ships. The graphics can stand on the same ground as something like Harbinger. However, this game has some deep, between the cracks flaws which keep it from realizing it's full potential. 

It's been a long time since any game has sucked me into the game play and made me feel like I'm there. A lot of my game buying experience is a desperate search for immersion and this game delivers. Traveling from one end of a universe to the other feels like a trek (especially with full fleets), you gain a real sense of accomplishment as you go from a single ship to 8 full fleets, and the universe you're put in will progress with you so that every day in game is a new day. The graphics can be down right beautiful at times; I had a sector filled with ice comets and an earth like planet which took my breath away. That sector is my home sector :)

Since this review is mostly for the developer, it will be more heavy on the criticisms since I'll be going into more detail. Please don't get me wrong, this game is a 4/5 for me at the moment and so tantalizingly close to 5 stars. 

First, let's talk about controls. The first suggestion I'll make before any other is every window needs a close box/X. It's pretty annoying to have to press back 4 times and then undock after searching for prices through the trader at an outpost. This situation of having to press back many times pops up pretty often and simply adding a close window option to the log window and others would be a massive quality of life improvement. It would also be nice if the camera could remember the distance you set it to instead of always defaulting to somewhere far. While we're talking about the camera, a free look function would also be awesome to have; I've been resorting to locking my camera and targeting outpost around a sector to get a good look. 

Also in line with controls is the actual act of trading. It can get tedious when you have to constantly switch ships or cargo to fill a fleet with goods or sell your goods. I think it should be possible to buy goods in one ship in a fleet and have any excess goods overflow into the other ships in the fleet and vice versa for selling, especially with the buy/sell as many as possible buttons in the trading interface. Another nice addition would be the ability to select systems in the galaxy map, see a list of stations, and be able to scan those stations.  This would be a massive quality of life improvement. 

In terms of graphics, I think adding life bars above the targeting reticles would be awesome. It can be tough to keep track of which ships need to be pulled out of a fight to keep them from being destroyed. 

Now let's talk game play. I have a lot to say here. 

Firstly, diplomacy and faction competition is really bare bones at the moment. Sure, there are individual factions, but the alliance lines are very cut and dry; there are good guys and bad guys and that's about it. You attack one good guy (even though the game says they have no allies) and you lose favoring with all good factions, which is most factions unfortunately.  It was pretty disappointing to find out I couldn't start a war with a competing faction because I'd become an enemy of every faction in their moral alignment. 

So why would I want to start a war? This game has a disappointing lack of conflict. Yes, you can have bounties on your head which will cause bounty hunters to chase you, and you might get the stray bandit capital ship raiding other ships, but by enlarge the bandits just have their assess handed to them. I've yet to see bandits take over whole systems or launch fleet sized raids. Just war in general hasn't  popped  up in this game, yet this game has all the elements for war. This game even has all the elements for trade war, but the pricing engine doesn't create a very diverse economy. You'll have a few systems offering different prices, but for the most part most stations offer the same prices, and even when there is variation it doesn't ever feel meaningful. Thankfully, where the stations are positioned and the quantity of goods they have does create meaningful diversity, but the pricing does need attention. This game is sort of in a state where you feel way too free yet constricted at the same time.

Here's my suggestions:
-moral alignment needs to go away and be replaced with more explicit alliances. As long as it's not just everybody who is honorable is now an ally, this will diversify and give more meaning to diplomacy. Instead of just asking yourself if you want to be evil, crooked, or honorable, you can ask do you want to be with the merchant clan, or the war clan, or the intellectual clan, for example. This can be accomplished by having factions that build outposts that support each other be allies (like if a refinery and small arms factory are in the same sector) and enemies if they compete (two refineries in the same sector). Trade could also increase alliance between npc factions. I think a bandit faction is still a good idea
-diplomacy also needs more depth. You're either at war with a faction or they don't care about you. Actual alliance or positive moral favor doesn't really bring any meaningful rewards besides not being at war with that faction. I think something like lowered or raised prices would be a good start. 
-bandits, especially during the late game, need to be more threatening. They need to start trying to take over whole systems and actually succeed in some cases. I want to see my trade routes disrupted and my authority in a sector challenged. 
-diplomatic relationships should decay, and what improves your standing with a faction should be limited so you can't be friends with ALL the good or bad guys, and they should be able to deteriorate to war, especially with crooked factions. Simply trading with one faction or doing their missions shouldn't give you favor with every faction of that moral alignment in my opinion
-I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation, but I'd like 50+sector universes



If you can't tell, I think this game holds the most potential in diplomacy. I think with just a few adjustments this game could really be a 5 star experience.

8669,InterstellarPilots,"Luxury Resources not Decaying in Custom Universe

In the preset universes the top tier resources (jewellery, hoverbikes, medkits etc) slowly disappear from the trade station. This is essential because stations have finite storage and nobody can buy top tier resources once they are sold to a trade station. This slow decay doesn't appear to occur when you play custom.

This results in all trade stations filling to capacity and being surrounded by hundreds of trading vessels unable to dock. Trade completely dies as a result. You can probably survive on mining, passengers and missions but eventually I assume all 2nd tier and primary resource stations would eventually fill up as well.

Anyone care to take a few and pen up some guides?
I'm still in the dark for example on station mechanics.
My best idea has been deploying 4 laser V batteries in the black sails system, and luring BS haulers from the asteroids to their doom and looting them.
This game gets developed further ai will probably be smart enough to avoid certain death.
Another tactic is the .99 cent fighter can be fit with 5 military launchers and take out any capital ship, leading to much lol's and 12k worth of loot.
Another stone age tactic if this game continues to be developed.
If I where the developer I would shamelessly push towards a single player EVE-Online type game and watch the cash roll in.

Just started my own budding refinery in Androla with an asteroid ring next to Gatopea wormhole. I currently have a fleet of 8 Hauler Ms and 3 have been assigned to my Androla refinery. The refinery and the asteroids are surrounded by a ring of 8 Laser Vs with overlapping cover

A lot of bandits and bounty hunters have been traversing that sector lately and have been attempting to pick off my Haulers esp the ones that seem to stray off to the edge.

I am also planning to expand my refinery empire in the more riskier Hellemus with my other Haulers since that is the only sector with Ice asteroids. However, 3 hostile factions have set up shipyards abt 20k away and there are frequent attacks by hostile Overlords.

TL;DR: I wanted to know a way to set my Haulers to auto-mine while cloaked or if there's a way I can make use of the cloaked function for the Hauler Ms to cloak when being attacked while uncloaking to mine

But what if I buy or sell to my own station? What happens? I'm particularly thinking about a refinery, but there may be other options.

Second, I'm curious about destroying stations. I've got a sector that I'm trying to build up in, and I had a pirate base pop up in the back corner. Assuming I blow it up and post some turrets at the entrance wormhole, will the pirates be able to simply spawn there in the future?

I suggest that you make a ship that lives of shields and has low armor and add shield piercing woepons to counteract them buff the fighters and make a new class for fighters interceptors that can go extremely fast but can only carry light weopons like lasers and have a advanced AI A dreadnaught class wich would be way more powerfull than anything we have seen 12 hangar bays whit huge amounts of woepons like 16 woepons a new railgun woepon wich could pierce multiple targets or be the shield bypassing weopon A corrosion cannon wich deals damage to armor over time but deals 50% lower damage to shields and uses ammo A laser weopon that bounces over other targets EMP cannons wich take away power supply and do more damage agaisnt shields. Equipable armors that would protect electronics from EMP woepons maybe Corrosion ressistant armor wich lowers the effect of corrosion cannons and maybe armor wich absorbs energy from laser woepons and add it to your capacitator buff the plasma weopons a bit theyre underpowered as a repeating issue that everyone uses nothing but lasers its kinda dull and boring and i want to see more variety wich means different weopons ships equipment in fleets and everything wich would make multyplayer if it would ever come even more entertaining as you have so much to choose from. Also i have more on a bigger set of commodoties make like gatopean gas that you can mine out of the planet wich would make mining also more interesting add starts where you can extract helium and hydrogen from them. To fix the issue of long times of travelling make a cruise drive wich would speed you up to 300 speed but drop your shields and impair your weopons kinda like cloak.

Scrolling through my property list literally takes minutes regardless of the amount of filters specified, with one swipe equating to (on average) 5 to 7 seconds of idle time before the UI responds to the input. Obviously, I realize the impact that such a massive amount of graphical data has on processor performance inherent in gaming on mobile devices like this but has anyone else that has experienced this know if freeing up drive space has any worthwhile effect on performance?

8777,InterstellarPilots,"Frustration with auto-trading.

So I started playing the game in the default universe and after about 8 hours of playing I had a fleet of ten ships and everything was fine.

Then I noticed I had a older APK and got the newest version (I hate google play and don't use it for apps if possible)

Anyway since updating the save file was gone so I made a custom universe, biggest size and started over.

This is where I get the problems, before I had zero issues with auto trading, and now despite having all intel on all sectors every single time my single ship enters a new sector while on it's way to pick up certain goods, it stops and goes back to finding another trade route, same thing if it runs into a ship or station and has to adjust course, it stops and starts looking for a new trade route. and this is so bad that last night while at work I left it running under my desk and checked on it after 4 hours of play, and my ship had not completed a single trade, it had just kept rerouting over and over again.

can someone tell me what the hell is up? did the update break everythin, or did they intentionally make trading on auto much harder?",2018-06-22 14:40:43,2,0,-0.8551,-1,-1,1.0

^^Sorry ^^for ^^making ^^another ^^post ^^but ^^i ^^feel ^^that ^^this ^^topic ^^is ^^entirely ^^different ^^from ^^my  ^^previous ^^post ^^and ^^needs ^^its ^^own ^^thread

--> Cloaking device on AI controlled Capital ship used for combat is a big NO NO NO.

I have an Overlord with a full compliment of Orion-X frigates with 2 Ares-X escorts as my main combat fleet. After several rounds of fighting missions i noticed that my Ares's hull are frequently damaged. I found the culprit to be the Cloaking Device because these Ares would always want to cloak during the thick of the battle. I then disabled its preference to cloak but the cloaking still happens during battle. So I then manually disabled the component itself but as soon as I issued an order the cloaking device is magically enabled again.. I think this is a bug

Nothing is wrong with my Orions because they can appear/disappear in just 1.2 sec (using the best cloaking device available for them) but the Ares and my Overlord takes 5 sec to do the same. During this period the ship drops shield and it very vulnerable to enemy fire.

--> How do I make a patrolling fleet?

I would like to defend my sector using a small fleet of Orions. Is this possible? If not, what would be the best way of stopping enemy ships from entering my sector?

I have a trading fleet of 6 Magnus-EQ+ upgraded to maximum, with 36 Thunder+ class escort vessels, all configured to Protect mode, 6 each per Magnus-EQ.  These vessels are equipped with top of the line cloaking systems and have ""Attack Hostiles"" and maximum aggression.

&#x200B;

My issue is the escorts never seem to do anything but ghost along silently.  The thought it they stay cloaked until an enemy engages, then they should decloak and start attacking any enemy threatening their parent vessel.  After the fight, they ought to recloak and wait for the next fight, slowly rebuilding their energy levels.

&#x200B;

What seems to be happening is they just remain in a cloaked state and let the enemy pound away on the Magnus shielding with impunity as if they were zero aggressive and were set to not attack anything at all.  My thought is the cloaks are keeping them from doing more than silently ghost along.

&#x200B;

Is there a way to fix this misbehaviour short of selling all those cloaking devices I purchased for the escort wing?

>Lone Survivor
I, Kim Haar J√∏rgensen (the primary creative force behind Interstellar Marines), am currently the only official developer working on the game. I can do almost everything, except programming, which I'm learning. 

>To be able to pay the bills at home, I'm currently working a full time job as ""Respiratory Handicap Helper"", which is both day and night shifts, allowing a fair amount of ""free"" time to work on Interstellar Marines.

>At the moment there is not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for Interstellar Marines, except the ultra clear ambitious vision of what Interstellar Marines will be once fully realized, some day.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines, until I go crazy or die trying or preferably manage to recreate, pickup, maintain traction, and conclude the game(s) envisioned.

>Update 27
The next short term goal is to finally get Update 27 out. Update 27 is centered mostly around expanding our combat sandbox arena called Wargames and fixing as many of our bugs as possible. (You can check our Trello page[trello.com] for progress and more details).

>In the long term the goals will be to get the game upgraded to Unity 5.6+ and make everything run smoother, be much more bug free, and prettier. This will allow us to expand in more interesting directions to chum players in.

>It's also a clear goal to make sure future updates, although small, will release more frequently.

>Moving forward
Lack of substantial progress in Early Access has resulted in a steady increase of negative reviews (understandably), which in turn have had a very serious effect on sales; creating a nasty downward spiral to the bottom of the foodchain.

>With the current negative review scores it will be much more difficult to attract publishers/investors to our game; although we will certainly still try. What‚Äôs more important is moving forward (even if slowly) and when things become more positive, more options will become available.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines with awesome people interested in helping out, that's for sure. I've been very fortunate to get this small handful of awesome volunteer community members on board to help out from time to time. I‚Äôm also blessed to have my brother-in-arms (ZPSSpectre) helping out with game design, military advisory, and community interaction. Only time will tell how this ""crowd sourcing"" adventure will turn out. 

>I can totally respect if you could not care less about me or this game anymore, it really has been too long a wait with way too little progress.

>If, on the other hand, you feel a sense of hope and power inside to keep fighting; I'll be honored and proud!

>Show don't tell is what I'm judging myself on, and this is just text. Back to work!

>FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME,

Greetings fellow IM players. Do you make youtube videos? Then you might be what we are looking for. I'm currently looking for fellow content creators for collab series in IM multiplayer. This particular collab requires quite ""few"" people and is going to be difficult one to pull off to time it up with everything so don't expect quick videos!

First things first:

1. You have to have atleast few videos on your channel. Your sub or view amount doesn't matter aslong as you actually create content. Everyone has to do their own recording & editing. Streaming WON'T be allowed/acceptable in most cases due the nature of format.

2. You have to have decent microphone, due the nature of collab you need to have microphone that doesn't compremise everyone elses audio in team setup. It doesn't need to be expensive one, just good enough not to ruin the audio for everyone else. 

3. Own legimate copy of Interstellar Marines. I'm not going to give you one and you won't be able to participate with pirated copy.

If you fulfill these three requirements and are intrested of joining the collab, hit me up on steam or in this topic. I'll have few questions prepared and more information what's going on.

8883,InterstellarMarines,"Simple goals for every new updates

The idea of this post is to make a list of simple things that would greatly improve the game. Ideally each new update would add 1 item to each categories.

* 1 weapon : pump action shotgun

 It's a gaming classic, it would work perfectly well in the IM universe, especially against CTR. 1 shot close range kill, with the drawback of slow rate of fire.

* 1 grenade : offensive grenade

 IM is *supposed* to be coop tactical, it's time to create the base for that. Add a grenade slot per player. Right now do a simple offensive grenade, that works well for everything.

* 1 equipment : explosive mine

 Once again, IM should be coop tactical (or at least tactical). Bring new pieces of equipment to add variety to the gameplay. As for the grenade, start with something simple such a mine, and expand from here.

* 1 mechanic : fluids

 Whenever a player would kill something at very close range, the target's bodily fluids (blood, oil...) would splash things, including the player's helmet. The more kill the dirtier your screen. You can then wipe them up by pressing a key. It's a simple gimmick that would reinforce the atmosphere.

* 1 map : Moon base.

 I don't care for hell week. Sadly it's the only way to play in new environments. Bring the maps from hell week to coop / TvT. It should be easy enough since the maps already exist, adapting them to other modes should be pretty simple.

Basically add 1 new item in each category for every new update. These should be simple goals that would quickly and easily expand IM's potential.

Example of other items for listed categories :

* weapons : sniper rifle, grenade launcher, LMG

* grenade : EMP, flashbang, healing grenade

* equipment : EMP mine, keycard tracker, door hacker (would allow to open doors from a distance), mine detector

* mechanic : melee, mag count (for realistic difficulty)

* map : all the maps from hell week

I'm sure there are other categories we could add to the list of things that are easy to do yet have a huge potential for the game. Feel free to add them if you think some other stuff should be listed. I didn't list new enemies because I feel these would require more work. Everything else they should be able to do for every update, at 1 update a month.",2016-03-22 16:37:24,9,0,-0.3818,-1,-1,1.0

 Hello everyone! I have been filming some consistent Interstellar Marines gameplay videos for almost a year now and I have decided to share it to the subreddit to give newcomers a feel for the game and maybe even pick up a few tactics and strategies along the way. It also boosts my channel's presence so that is always much appreciated :)

 Each episode incorporates 10-15 minutes of edited Interstellar Marines gameplay from a growing YouTuber and team manager of the Interstellar Marines Professional Team, Amorous Congress (myself!). They are posted weekly on Thursday at 6AM Eastern Standard Time and will always include a trivia question from the Interstellar Marines universe and last episode's winner. Viewers are always allowed to add me on steam unless their account looks spammy, and everyone is free to join the game while I am filming! 

 I hope you all enjoy this series as much as I love making it, and I look forward to bringing you along for the ride that is Interstellar Marines!

8891,InterstellarMarines,"Open Letter to the IM Devs

Going to post this here, since their site won't even load right now for me lmao.

Dear Developers,

As someone who has had this game for a year and a half, bought eight copies for myself, friends, and family, and has been so unbelievably hyped for this game; I suggest you go and read the reviews section of your game on steam. A year ago, I think I recall it being positive, and now its' mixed. Yes, you know why? Because in ALL honesty, no hate or insults implied, this is the same game it was a year ago. One new map and a hunger games type game mode was refreshing, but after 2-4 hours of playing, you've seen it all. You improved the sounds, the animations, and fixed the numbers bugs that were around. Yes, and thank you, but all those give are momentary moments of glee. This game is transitioning into a war game like CS:GO, Insurgency, or Battlefield and is hardly the intense, strategically oriented, and team based game you CONTINUOUSLY make it out to be. I think myself, and most of your players, are SICK of seeing all these hot fixes that add nothing new to the game. You guys need to make a cup of coffee, pop some popcorn, and sit down around a PC and **READ** every review that's negative, because most of them make sense. 

You guys are focusing too much on the tiny nitty gritty bits of game making that is ruining it for many of your players. We want better guns, we want more **STEALTH** oriented maps, more levels that actually force us to watch each other's backs and keep a level of tense atmosphere. The NeuroGen Incident was so unbelievably fun the first time, but that's it, the first time. Maybe it lasted a week, a month, several months for some people, but it damn well won't last us much longer. The NeuroGen incident is the embodiment of everything you make this game out to be, and we want more of those kinds of maps guys. 

I'm no game developer, but I know that switching game engines will also delay the update process. Seriously, I think most gamers value mechanics over graphics. Some of the best games right now, have half the graphics newer but less popular games do. Counter-Strike is 15 year olds and then some and the newest edition is hardly a graphical improvement from Source, yet it's steam's most purchased game. Half-Life, the beloved masterpiece of Valve, has god awful graphics, and is still played today. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic has horrid graphics, but it's considered one of the best RPG games made and still has a decent player base for such an old game. Mechanics over graphics, will always make a game better. Please, straighten out your priorities with this game. We've had the same weapons for a year, with some minor tweaks. The same combat style more or less. We need updates on these aspects, and you guys have to deliver.

Also, while I have zero knowledge on the financial status of IM, I am pretty damn sure you guys have been well funded for 2015, and considering you don't have that many servers, or SEA servers it seems, I think your funds are mostly intact. Of course there are aspects I don't know about, but more or less, this game is earning. That fact will **stop** if you guys don't pick up the pace. IM is currently less playable than a game like Unturned, being developed by one person, who initially most likely earned less than IM due to it being a free game. Again, a game where graphics are trumped by mechanics. Please IM, more mechanics are long overdue for IM. 


Overall, I hope you guys haven't wasted the money of the thousands of people who have supported you. I'm not mad, just disappointed that such a great game concept looks like it'll never be finished. I pray and hope you boys prove me wrong, because I do wanna see IM as a finished, polished game, someday. 

If you really are community oriented, hopefully you'll accept criticism and use it to improve your product. ",2016-01-03 07:06:40,19,0,0.9977,1,1,1.0

8894,InterstellarMarines,"Where is this game even going?

I just got out of a match filled with team killing, cross-team teamspeak shenanigans to control entire rounds and straight up neglect for anyone wanting to actually play the game.

...And this is saddening, since there's only ever one multiplayer server decently filled up with players at a time. And multiplayer is the only entertaining (and I use that word lightly) thing to do, since SP and CO-OP have had their replay value wringed dry from the sponge that is this game.

I'm so sorry for being a negative nancy, but I really don't see where this game is headed. Or rather, I DO see what it's aiming for, but the path being taken to get there is just so... *Whuh?* A lot of minor features are being prioritised over what could be bigger, more entertaining core features. No, not campaign, I get that the game itself needs to be on a good foundation before a good campaign can even be conceived. And not co-op either, because if any more co-op is made with the way the game is now... it'll barely hold anyone's attention for more than a run or two. Hell, not even Landsharks or Mechs yet, I'd hate for two of the game's biggest shticks to be crammed in and sloppily done.

But I played a match yesterday, *almost* filled to capacity of the server, with people who I figured weren't too tightly knit with the community. I figured it'd be better to ask *the average player* what they thought the game REALLY needed right now (rather than the die-hard *BELIEVE* fan who'll talk your ear off about the game needing to be more realistic).

And summed up, they said:

* Weapons, for more variation. Sniper, DMR, shotgun, etc. (*""27 weapons along with numerous accessories, gadgets and equipment.""* Or even, *""Freely customizable weapons simulation.""* Yeah, can we start to see some of this? Bullseye even had interchangeable sights.)
* Grenades, or equipment in general.
* Loadouts customisable from the menu (to allow selection of the above two. Primary, secondary (which would just be pistol for the time being) and equipment) That and player customisation in general. One of the ambitious goals is to let the player be their own Interstellar Marine, yes? We're still all... painfully normal. (*""Persistent character development and skill system.""*)
* DM on a map like Starcrown. Oddly specific, but the idea was DM muck around with no limitations on maps of the player's choice.
* Laser pointers with only the dot, not the strobe. Another specific, but the lasersight does more harm than good. Would be great if we could still see the strobe for allies, to see where they're aiming, because... tactics?

And then, some other things I've heard in passing for more general things that *might* help. I doubt it though. Stuff like leaning, map design that doesn't feel like you can be shot from anywhere, updating your website so the forum spam is fixed & the most recent thing isn't Sitrep 4, performance improvements, a melee to not kill but at least deter the people who spray & pray charge (and helps SP/COOP because bots) and just... performance improvements all around.

I know you guys are a small team. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that things are the way they are. I get it, one step at a time... but try to take the right steps in the right order. It's a little depressing that people don't have much of a reason to *stay* and keep playing. The game needs something to work towards, progression. The TR system is so... wow. Apparently you guys ARE working on a progression system, I've seen the prologue mockup... And frankly, it looks great. Put ALL your effort into that and everything that needs to surround that to make it work. Clearing missions, challenges and so on for unlocks seems great! But if the missions/challenges are painfully simple, few & far between, or even give lackluster rewards (""You've unlocked *1,000 TR points!*"" or ""You've unlocked an *emblem/achievement!*"") then it'll be a flop. IM is already on life support as it is in terms of fame & playing population, I've got no idea how the financial situation is, but again, goodluck.

8901,InterstellarMarines,"TBH, i think this is where IM shrines.

okay, I am a tactical nerd and i am a big sucker for the feeling of being a spec op solider. hence why i am also a big fan of airsoft and such. the atmosphere in IM is what i have been looking for and what i got with airsoft, not only the shot matters. the sound. and amoung other things make this game so intense. and those are the awesome moments. ""i hear them under me, i walked down the stairs slowly while aiming. then took them out one by one. the voice tells me that the alarm is triggered. i quickly reload."" looking at that big cargo door while positioning myself that provide cover from the cargo door and the stairs direction i came from. they beached. i fire. took out 4 CTR, heard the dog on top opened, the gun's dry. switched to what they called a pistol. and then took out another 2 CTR.""

This is so AWESOME... i have that feeling of being a spec op!! okay. i think where IM shines is the large open map that i can pick my point of entry. while needing to complete secondary objectives in order to get to the main objective. i can see myself playing this ALOT, if everytime i load into the map, it is different weather, different patrol from the CTR, different position. different objective. IE: Take out the HVT, or rescue, or destroy.... (insert objective here). and maybe randomize our equipment, with one base pistols. (maybe lol). the most important. better CTR!!!! or maybe other enemies going on.

So yeah, the assault rifle in this game cannot hit a droid that is very close to you as the model clips through the bot and shoots behind it-unless you back off a bit.   
Intentional or bug I do not know, but I feel this is actually a good balancing mechanic to encourage the SMG use vs melee enemies and balance the assault rifle as the ranged option.  
This is also realistic as when something is so close as to punch you(body to body), the length of the weapon really does play a role.Assault rifles and especially the one seen in the game are quite long.So if someone has approached you past the gun's barrel it is actually not easy to turn the gun and manage to shoot him when it's so long.  
You hAve to step back a bit, making the assault rifle a tad bit handicapped, only for melee enemies that have managed to rush you.

I want to put together a tactical squad of 4 guys. We would be focused on sticking together, covering fire sectors, providing cover fire so we can move forward as a unit.

We'd randomly choose Squad Leader(who would also act as Alpha leader when the squad splits) and Bravo leader.

8998,InterstellarMarines,"What mods would *you* make?

If Interstellar Marines gets mod support, what would *you* make? Hostage rescue from the early Rainbow Six games? Bomb planting/disarming from Counter-Strike? America's Army type VIP extraction? Terrorist Hunt from the Rainbow Six Vegas series?


Personally, I'd love to make a mod like The Thing, where one of you is an enemy creature, indistinguishable from the rest.

.

**The Thing from outer space**

All players begin the game unarmed, grouped in twos and threes around the map. One players spawns as *The Thing*!

.

**Setup:**

Players spawn in twos and threes around the various parts of the facility. Players achieve victory by defeating *The Thing*. One player is informed that he is *The Thing*. He achieves victory once all players are eliminated or have been infected and finish gestating into more of *The Thing*.

.

**Play:**

Players begin with several chores (objectives) they must complete as part of their research on the station. Completing a chore will bring a reward, such as extra medical equipment, extra weapons, a backup generator, etc. As prerequisite chores are completed, new chores are awarded. Until all the prerequisite chores are completed, you do not know which chores are coming up. Damage to certain systems will make some chores impossible, and you may eventually run out of possible chores by this fact.

.

**The Thing:**

The Thing is an alien lifeform that can take the shape of living creatures. The Thing starts as helpless as any other human, and remains indistinguishable from other during its gestation period of several minutes. After its gestation completes, the creature gains superhuman endurance and the ability to infect other players.

.


**Environmental Interactivity:**

You're trapped in a station with various systems that can be activated/deactivated/destroyed. The medical lab can be set up to test your blood for the infection. (A player must perform several time-intensive tasks in the medical lab to set up the experiment, then players' blood can be tested.) The radio station can be used to call for help, tricking the hapless responders into permitting the creature to escape. (Sets a countdown timer, after which the creature wins if it has not been eliminated.) The infirmary can stabilize players who've been heavily injured and are ""bleeding out"", but it can be locked, damaged, or destroyed. (Must be damaged/destroyed from the inside.) The power can be destroyed, slowly freezing the humans to death. (They can win by destroying the creature before their time expires.) The armory can be locked/unlocked/destroyed, and keys distributed. (Players begin unarmed and defenseless, but a variety of weapons are available. Some simply kill things, a limited few can reveal the creature's nature if it is adequately injured.) If enough chores are completed, a preventative vaccine can be created in the medical lab (if it still exists!), or the entire station may be self-destructed, resulting in an automatic victory for the scientists over *The Thing*.


.


**Communication:**

Players may communicate by radio (visor down) or face-to-face (visor up). Radio communications are audible to *all* players, including *The Thing*. Face-to-face communication is limited in range, and works as demonstrated in the Interstellar Marines audio occlusion demo. Players wishing to plot in secret (or who wish to voice suspicions in private!) will have to use face-to-face communication, requiring physical proximity.

.

**Weaponry:**

Most weapons begin locked in the Armory. The Armory begins unlocked, but may be locked, unlocked, and destroyed. In addition to weapons which may be used to kill regularly, the Armory also includes a few flamethrowers, which reveal when a player is *The Thing* if they do adequate damage, or are used on a corpse. Additional flamethrowers and ammunition may be obtained by completing chores.


.


**Infection and Gestation:**

*The Thing* can infect players once it finishes gestating. Infection is a harmless (no damage) process, which takes place instantaneously. There is a very clear animation that shows when *The Thing* is infecting someone, so it is best to infect players alone and from behind. A player will not know he has been infected if he does not see himself get infected. Once a player is infected, he immediately begins gestating.

Gestation takes several minutes, and occurs in three phases. In the first phase, the player cannot be distinguished from other players by any means, including a blood test. One-third of the way through gestation, the player reaches the acute infection point, after which blood tests will confirm that the player is infected. Two-thirds of the way through infection, the player reaches the critical point. Once a player reaches the critical point, he is notified that he is infected, and his vision changes slightly to show him that he is infected. Once gestation completes, the player is *The Thing*, and can infect other players.

.

**Victory:**

The scientists win by defeating *The Thing,* and killing any infected players. *The Thing* wins by killing all scientists.

Players who have been infected (but have not finished gestating) count as scientists. Any infected player who dies *before* gestation completes wins and loses with the scientists. Thus, a player who has reached the critical point of gestation knows he must be killed, but is faced with the dilemma of whether he wants to win with the players or with *The Thing.*

.

.

Originally founded by Bernard Matheus Crown in the early 21st century as a small fleet for the service of exclusive and affluent clients, Starcrown Aerospace has grown over the last 40 years into one of the largest commercial fleets in ITO‚Äôs airspace. At any given time, 83% of all active vessels belong or have been designed by them. Additionally, Starcrown Aerospace has placed a heavy focus on research and development since the passing of its founder in 2076, creating the conditions and technologies that assisted mankind in thriving throughout the Solar System. 

Bernard Crown has always had a fascination with flying. His father, Matheus Crown, was a pilot in the armed forces. When off duty, he would take his son with him to the aerodrome to fly with him on an old Cessna 172. Whilst other kids his age spent the weekends in front of computer screens, Bernard Crown was often flying with his father. Piloting became a hobby from early childhood. He had his private pilot license before graduating high school, and a commercial pilot license during college. 

He founded Crown Aerospace after graduating from Cambridge University in Applied Social Sciences. His father retired from the armed forces and became his first employee. Over the years, Starcrown Aerospace grew from a family-sized company, with a heavy focus on quality of service to the wealthy and powerful, to the behemoth of commercial airspace.

His last decades were of philanthropy and social responsibility, perhaps a reflection of his humanistic education in social sciences. After a lifetime of flying the skies, or ""stretching his wings"", as he would often put it, Crown believed a single planet was not sufficient to hold the spirit of mankind, it was time for humanity to join the alluring vastness of space. Working in close proximity with several of ITO's divisions, Bernard Crown elaborated a civilian colonisation plan that spread over half our home system, providing the required means of transportation for millions of civilians from all around the globe aboard, for example, the Aerobus 450F, one of the first-approved large-scale civilian transport ships and still the hallmark of civilian spaceflight today.

Although primarily a civilian aeronautics company, Starcrown Aerospace's role in advancing the colonisation of the Solar System, continuous collaboration with ITO, and the quality of technology developed by their research division, has provided this company with its fair share of government contracts, particularly in developing military-grade vessels, like the iconic Megalodon OPD-3A dropship.

Attention to all crew, some of our benefactors from the neurogen pharma corporation are to use this facility on the 27th of this month. The purpose of this meeting is to increase their financial support to the vital work we're developing here. I here request that all service and maintenance personnel to perform a full check on the station's main systems and ready uniform in pristine condition. To the research teams, please provide updated reports on your work as soon as possible, for presentation and evaluation.

[AUDIO LOG 2] Sarah Magellan 01

Its always the same thing, doesn't matter whether your still in college or at top level private company. Something always goes missing. Honestly how does Doctor Barbero expect me to continue work when the supplies keep going missing.

[AUDIO LOG 3] Leo Stark 01

Doctor Sarah was right, someone is accessing the storage room taking supplies without signing them off. Whoever it is, only old time stamps left. I can't identify anything else. I'll ask Hank Choo to check on this and see if anyone altered the access mechanism but I'm still waiting for his report. I should notify Mr. Snyder about this.

[AUDIO LOG 4] Hank Choo 01

Leo Stark asked me to check on the access door to the storage room. Apparently someone has been accessing it without leaving any record of who's access card was used. The access mechanism is working fine and the manual override hasn't been used as far as I can tell. Given the circumstances I think someone got their hands on a skeleton key but the only people able to produce one would be: me, David Calru and Snyder. Still not sure if I should report this back to Mr. Lee or Mr. Snyder

[AUDIO LOG 5] William Barbero 01

Snyder just came around asking about the missing supplies from storage. Had to tell him about Dr. Magellan's latest break through and about the replication of the results. He became rather interested in my own side experiments, asking me to continue and not to worry about doc's investigation. Apparently hes contacting the ITO defense department are interested in this kind of research. Which means funding is no longer an issue, even if neurogen pulls the plug on us.

[AUDIO LOG 6] Leo Stark 02

Just finished reading Hank's and Choo's report. He can't find anything wrong with the access mechanism to the storage area. So I got no other option but to keep a close eye on this. To make matters worse, when I mentioned this event to Snyder. He said if I couldn't find anything else, I should just let it die. I can't do that,m I have an obligation to these people, there safety is my responsibility. If theres any foul play and it endangers the crew, I'll be crucified.

[AUDIO LOG 7] Hank Choo 02

Talking to Mr. Snyder about the storage situation seemed to expedite our next delivery. Neurogen headquarters is sending a coald mission 18 days ahead of schedule I'll have to send a team to clear the hangar bay for the extra supply we're getting but at least Kimmie will have a birthday gift in time this year, instead of having to wait for the usual delivery date despite all the hassle theres a silver lining. I really hope she likes it... I miss my little girl.

[AUDIO LOG 8] Sarah Magellan 02

Finally some progress! The subject has shown improvement in the profita test and sensorial memory after only 3 weeks of being administrated ""Anti-17"" compound on a daily basis. Most of the subjects also have shown intermittent explosive disorder. A behavioral disorder characterized by extreme expression of anger often to the point of a controlled rage. It is yet unclear if it the result of the lesions in the prefrontal cortex caused by the alzheimer's or if it is a side effect of the drug, we'll have to wait for the autopsy to make sure.

[AUDIO LOG 9] William Barbero 02

Dr. Magellan's latest results are quite promising, however, she did forget to mention some rather interesting side effects on a small percentage of the test sample. Some of the subjects exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to pain, increased aggressiveness and intermittent explosive disorder as reported previously by Dr. Magellan. On a special note the sample in the sample takes that aggression to rather extreme perpicks. I cobbled off the subjects forged channer to the point of inflicting lethal injuries on one another without stopping or diminishing the ferocity of the attacks.

[AUDIO LOG 10] Ellen Weaver 01

I've had to deal with more complaints than usual this week because of the communication restrictions... Adrub is correct in the pass of them. After our arrangement with the ITO, we must be very careful with the information we let slip to the outside. As these sent board of investors have had the opportunity to weight in on the matter I'm sure we agree on Rupert decision to let Doctor Barberos pursue his new avenue of research. Besides it'll surely provide much better profit we achieve by trading the sith key.

[AUDIO LOG 11] Sarah Magellan 03

Dr. Barbero has been moody as of late, since my last breakthrough, hes been so focused on his lab he barely takes a rest. I'm concern he'll soon enough have a nervous breakdown. I don't get it why hes acting like this. I mean I know the investor meeting is in a couple of days and the progress we've had is tremendous. I'm sure neurogen will continue to fund us. There is no need for this.

[AUDIO LOG 12] William Barbero 03

I've been replication Dr. Magellan's experiment and finally identified and isolated neurogenic prenos for the decreased sensitivity to pain. aggressiveness and reminiscences to shoot. One way to control this was to include an energy plutonic agent that increases sensibility to suggestion. The aggression is still there but the subjects can be more easily controlled by a third party. Also aerial dispersion of modified viral agent has proven to be just as effective as in its original formation and much simpler to apply. Just need to place samples on a closed environment and its ready.

[AUDIO LOG 13] Miki Byen 01

As usual this time of year I rounded up all of the station's personnel including the patients and conducted the mandatory medical check up. Still how I hate it when people call me Dr. Bennerd its like the running joke when its time to draw some blood. REALLY? How difficult is it to say Dr. Miki Byen. Anyway the first lab works are complete and theres a potentially alarming result, Dr. Barbero's blood work is very similar to one of the patient Dakota Dakoo. One of the volunteers from ITO military fortunately I won't be able to report this to headquarters until communications are restored. While I notified Snyder about it, hopefully he'll take some safety measures.

[AUDIO LOG 14] Sarah Magellan 04

I just had to go and see Snyder. Willia uhhh Dr. Barberos behavior of late is starting to really concern me he no longer lets his research assistant in the lab and shuts anyone who even passes by. I hope Snyder can talk him into taking sometime off, he really needs it.

[AUDIO LOG 15] William Barbero 04

After all our staunt to bring it to the neurogen research department. That whiny little bitch went over my back to Rupert. What's it to her if I'm spending too much time in my lab. Its MY DAMN work. She wouldn't be so damn pinulated if I showed her my own progress. (long sigh) Maybe I should.

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 01] Sarah Magellan 01

Dr. Barbero keeps pushing hard on our work I don't understand why hes rushing this, I keep getting the same results and the equipment degrades faster. I wonder if the investor meeting in a few days has anything to do with it. Either way David is going to have to hurry back to the lab. At Least with Rupert supporting us, we won't have to wait for long

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 02] David Cutler 01

I'm really starting to loose my patience with this women. I know bloody well that her work is important but other people need their equipment as well. If it wasn't for Snyder pushing her to the top of the pile the other labs would be performing much better. Atleast shes much easier than doctor Barberos as of late. That man is becoming quite stressful to be around, he's spending too much time in the lab

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 03] Hank Choo 03

Another one of those seminars, I bet Cutler has been hating on the new research assistant. Awww that cute little redhead I mean that guy is good at what he does but damn he caught a horna. Soon enough either Snyder or neurogen is going to have him put in his own little cage. Come on little ape. Come on. Good boy. hahahahaha what a sight.

Okay, I've had the game for about a year now, playing occasionally with the updates. Obviously, I just got in and am playing the coop campaign. Now I have to ask, is the mission possible to beat? We got to the part that tells us to get to the room underneath the plant room (terrarium?) and we have been searching every nook and cranny of the station for the past 45 minutes and can't find anything. Its getting ridiculous. I was just informed we have 10 minutes remaining. How on Earth are we supposed to finish?

Update: I got into another game with someone who claims to have gotten past this part. He says there's supposed to be a key card in one of the crew bunks on the top level. However, we searched every single bunk and only found an audio log. The door he said he went through before was locked. Did the map glitch? I don't know. I give up for today.

I was pretty happy when I saw gameplay footage of this game and even happier when I bought it. What I didn't know was all the work that went into the background.

If you're loosely part of the community, I urge you to take a look. You WILL be impressed.

As a student who spends a lot of free time working with Unity, I find all of this even more intriguing. I have so many questions for the developers about how they got things working.

I am a big fan of the gameplay of Interstellar Marines because its a slower paced shooter. The speed of the game allows for a tactical approche ingame. All in all it somehow reminded me of Counter Strike, naturally i got really pumped when i read that they wanted to encourage professional gaming which means: good Anti Cheat, good hit detection and balanced weaponry and all that with a focus on realism (at least from a graphical point of view).

I am just interested if thats basically the reason for everyone currently playing or are you hoping for future updates for faster paced movement (sprint? oh god please no), the dynamic maps or what ever.

Generally I run the game at 60 fps but during the stutter it drops to 1-2 fps. The sound also has a significant stutter. The stutter seems to happen when bullets are sparking off objects, when lights turn on and off and when sounds such as gun shots and the announcer happen.

9111,InterstellarMarines,"Jumping?

Will there be jumping in the game? I've been searching around a little and have mostly found personal opinions about jumping. Most people seem to turn down the idea of having jumping in the game.

I myself hope that they will add jumping, just because it gives the feeling of being able to go places you would not have been without.

I read a steam(?) comment from the developers that leaning and other movement was going to be added to the game, but I am not sure if that included jumping or not.

[Early accesss update 3 image](http://media.interstellarmarines.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/steamearlyaccess/interstellarmarines_early_access_update_3_small.jpg)

It‚Äôs time to bring out the ‚ÄúM‚Äù in maintenance update (sorry, we just had to)! 

This time we‚Äôve updated the game to the latest version of Unity (version 4.2) which have solved a few of our outstanding crash bugs and given us a slight performance increase on all platforms. But the big ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù news is that due to the huge support we‚Äôve received on Steam we‚Äôve added a few more people to the team which will help us get more beefy updates out the door sooon! 

Update #4 is planned for Friday next week (if everything goes according to our plans) and in this update we hope to bring you a new large outdoor map staged to simulate an atmospheric evacuation zone right at the heart of a moist swamp environment. We‚Äôll also be working on an initial profile implementation for your combat training stats and maybe we‚Äôll even throw in a small surprise from your subconscious... 

Improvements
UPDATED: game engine to Unity 4.2 (overall better performance) 

UPDATED: team with 2 new (old) members Reese and Heks (level designer and music composer) and increased office map size 

UPDATED: game to default to fullscreen native resolution on first startup (possibly fixes ""black screen on startup"" bug?) 

UPDATED: OpenGL shadow filtering so shadows on OSX are just as pretty as Windows 

UPDATED: better shadow casting performance 


Fixes

FIXED: GetThreadContext crash occurring on some Windows PCs 
REMOVED: temporary ""game crashes on quit"" hotfix

>Lone Survivor
I, Kim Haar J√∏rgensen (the primary creative force behind Interstellar Marines), am currently the only official developer working on the game. I can do almost everything, except programming, which I'm learning. 

>To be able to pay the bills at home, I'm currently working a full time job as ""Respiratory Handicap Helper"", which is both day and night shifts, allowing a fair amount of ""free"" time to work on Interstellar Marines.

>At the moment there is not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for Interstellar Marines, except the ultra clear ambitious vision of what Interstellar Marines will be once fully realized, some day.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines, until I go crazy or die trying or preferably manage to recreate, pickup, maintain traction, and conclude the game(s) envisioned.

>Update 27
The next short term goal is to finally get Update 27 out. Update 27 is centered mostly around expanding our combat sandbox arena called Wargames and fixing as many of our bugs as possible. (You can check our Trello page[trello.com] for progress and more details).

>In the long term the goals will be to get the game upgraded to Unity 5.6+ and make everything run smoother, be much more bug free, and prettier. This will allow us to expand in more interesting directions to chum players in.

>It's also a clear goal to make sure future updates, although small, will release more frequently.

>Moving forward
Lack of substantial progress in Early Access has resulted in a steady increase of negative reviews (understandably), which in turn have had a very serious effect on sales; creating a nasty downward spiral to the bottom of the foodchain.

>With the current negative review scores it will be much more difficult to attract publishers/investors to our game; although we will certainly still try. What‚Äôs more important is moving forward (even if slowly) and when things become more positive, more options will become available.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines with awesome people interested in helping out, that's for sure. I've been very fortunate to get this small handful of awesome volunteer community members on board to help out from time to time. I‚Äôm also blessed to have my brother-in-arms (ZPSSpectre) helping out with game design, military advisory, and community interaction. Only time will tell how this ""crowd sourcing"" adventure will turn out. 

>I can totally respect if you could not care less about me or this game anymore, it really has been too long a wait with way too little progress.

>If, on the other hand, you feel a sense of hope and power inside to keep fighting; I'll be honored and proud!

>Show don't tell is what I'm judging myself on, and this is just text. Back to work!

Greetings fellow IM players. Do you make youtube videos? Then you might be what we are looking for. I'm currently looking for fellow content creators for collab series in IM multiplayer. This particular collab requires quite ""few"" people and is going to be difficult one to pull off to time it up with everything so don't expect quick videos!

First things first:

1. You have to have atleast few videos on your channel. Your sub or view amount doesn't matter aslong as you actually create content. Everyone has to do their own recording & editing. Streaming WON'T be allowed/acceptable in most cases due the nature of format.

2. You have to have decent microphone, due the nature of collab you need to have microphone that doesn't compremise everyone elses audio in team setup. It doesn't need to be expensive one, just good enough not to ruin the audio for everyone else. 

3. Own legimate copy of Interstellar Marines. I'm not going to give you one and you won't be able to participate with pirated copy.

If you fulfill these three requirements and are intrested of joining the collab, hit me up on steam or in this topic. I'll have few questions prepared and more information what's going on.

9203,InterstellarMarines,"Simple goals for every new updates

The idea of this post is to make a list of simple things that would greatly improve the game. Ideally each new update would add 1 item to each categories.

* 1 weapon : pump action shotgun

 It's a gaming classic, it would work perfectly well in the IM universe, especially against CTR. 1 shot close range kill, with the drawback of slow rate of fire.

* 1 grenade : offensive grenade

 IM is *supposed* to be coop tactical, it's time to create the base for that. Add a grenade slot per player. Right now do a simple offensive grenade, that works well for everything.

* 1 equipment : explosive mine

 Once again, IM should be coop tactical (or at least tactical). Bring new pieces of equipment to add variety to the gameplay. As for the grenade, start with something simple such a mine, and expand from here.

* 1 mechanic : fluids

 Whenever a player would kill something at very close range, the target's bodily fluids (blood, oil...) would splash things, including the player's helmet. The more kill the dirtier your screen. You can then wipe them up by pressing a key. It's a simple gimmick that would reinforce the atmosphere.

* 1 map : Moon base.

 I don't care for hell week. Sadly it's the only way to play in new environments. Bring the maps from hell week to coop / TvT. It should be easy enough since the maps already exist, adapting them to other modes should be pretty simple.

Basically add 1 new item in each category for every new update. These should be simple goals that would quickly and easily expand IM's potential.

Example of other items for listed categories :

* weapons : sniper rifle, grenade launcher, LMG

* grenade : EMP, flashbang, healing grenade

* equipment : EMP mine, keycard tracker, door hacker (would allow to open doors from a distance), mine detector

* mechanic : melee, mag count (for realistic difficulty)

* map : all the maps from hell week

I'm sure there are other categories we could add to the list of things that are easy to do yet have a huge potential for the game. Feel free to add them if you think some other stuff should be listed. I didn't list new enemies because I feel these would require more work. Everything else they should be able to do for every update, at 1 update a month.",2016-03-22 16:37:24,9,0,-0.3818,-1,-1,1.0

 Hello everyone! I have been filming some consistent Interstellar Marines gameplay videos for almost a year now and I have decided to share it to the subreddit to give newcomers a feel for the game and maybe even pick up a few tactics and strategies along the way. It also boosts my channel's presence so that is always much appreciated :)

 Each episode incorporates 10-15 minutes of edited Interstellar Marines gameplay from a growing YouTuber and team manager of the Interstellar Marines Professional Team, Amorous Congress (myself!). They are posted weekly on Thursday at 6AM Eastern Standard Time and will always include a trivia question from the Interstellar Marines universe and last episode's winner. Viewers are always allowed to add me on steam unless their account looks spammy, and everyone is free to join the game while I am filming! 

 I hope you all enjoy this series as much as I love making it, and I look forward to bringing you along for the ride that is Interstellar Marines!

Going to post this here, since their site won't even load right now for me lmao.

Dear Developers,

As someone who has had this game for a year and a half, bought eight copies for myself, friends, and family, and has been so unbelievably hyped for this game; I suggest you go and read the reviews section of your game on steam. A year ago, I think I recall it being positive, and now its' mixed. Yes, you know why? Because in ALL honesty, no hate or insults implied, this is the same game it was a year ago. One new map and a hunger games type game mode was refreshing, but after 2-4 hours of playing, you've seen it all. You improved the sounds, the animations, and fixed the numbers bugs that were around. Yes, and thank you, but all those give are momentary moments of glee. This game is transitioning into a war game like CS:GO, Insurgency, or Battlefield and is hardly the intense, strategically oriented, and team based game you CONTINUOUSLY make it out to be. I think myself, and most of your players, are SICK of seeing all these hot fixes that add nothing new to the game. You guys need to make a cup of coffee, pop some popcorn, and sit down around a PC and **READ** every review that's negative, because most of them make sense. 

You guys are focusing too much on the tiny nitty gritty bits of game making that is ruining it for many of your players. We want better guns, we want more **STEALTH** oriented maps, more levels that actually force us to watch each other's backs and keep a level of tense atmosphere. The NeuroGen Incident was so unbelievably fun the first time, but that's it, the first time. Maybe it lasted a week, a month, several months for some people, but it damn well won't last us much longer. The NeuroGen incident is the embodiment of everything you make this game out to be, and we want more of those kinds of maps guys. 

I'm no game developer, but I know that switching game engines will also delay the update process. Seriously, I think most gamers value mechanics over graphics. Some of the best games right now, have half the graphics newer but less popular games do. Counter-Strike is 15 year olds and then some and the newest edition is hardly a graphical improvement from Source, yet it's steam's most purchased game. Half-Life, the beloved masterpiece of Valve, has god awful graphics, and is still played today. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic has horrid graphics, but it's considered one of the best RPG games made and still has a decent player base for such an old game. Mechanics over graphics, will always make a game better. Please, straighten out your priorities with this game. We've had the same weapons for a year, with some minor tweaks. The same combat style more or less. We need updates on these aspects, and you guys have to deliver.

Also, while I have zero knowledge on the financial status of IM, I am pretty damn sure you guys have been well funded for 2015, and considering you don't have that many servers, or SEA servers it seems, I think your funds are mostly intact. Of course there are aspects I don't know about, but more or less, this game is earning. That fact will **stop** if you guys don't pick up the pace. IM is currently less playable than a game like Unturned, being developed by one person, who initially most likely earned less than IM due to it being a free game. Again, a game where graphics are trumped by mechanics. Please IM, more mechanics are long overdue for IM. 


Overall, I hope you guys haven't wasted the money of the thousands of people who have supported you. I'm not mad, just disappointed that such a great game concept looks like it'll never be finished. I pray and hope you boys prove me wrong, because I do wanna see IM as a finished, polished game, someday. 

If you really are community oriented, hopefully you'll accept criticism and use it to improve your product. ",2016-01-03 07:06:40,19,0,0.9977,1,1,1.0

9214,InterstellarMarines,"Where is this game even going?

I just got out of a match filled with team killing, cross-team teamspeak shenanigans to control entire rounds and straight up neglect for anyone wanting to actually play the game.

...And this is saddening, since there's only ever one multiplayer server decently filled up with players at a time. And multiplayer is the only entertaining (and I use that word lightly) thing to do, since SP and CO-OP have had their replay value wringed dry from the sponge that is this game.

I'm so sorry for being a negative nancy, but I really don't see where this game is headed. Or rather, I DO see what it's aiming for, but the path being taken to get there is just so... *Whuh?* A lot of minor features are being prioritised over what could be bigger, more entertaining core features. No, not campaign, I get that the game itself needs to be on a good foundation before a good campaign can even be conceived. And not co-op either, because if any more co-op is made with the way the game is now... it'll barely hold anyone's attention for more than a run or two. Hell, not even Landsharks or Mechs yet, I'd hate for two of the game's biggest shticks to be crammed in and sloppily done.

But I played a match yesterday, *almost* filled to capacity of the server, with people who I figured weren't too tightly knit with the community. I figured it'd be better to ask *the average player* what they thought the game REALLY needed right now (rather than the die-hard *BELIEVE* fan who'll talk your ear off about the game needing to be more realistic).

And summed up, they said:

* Weapons, for more variation. Sniper, DMR, shotgun, etc. (*""27 weapons along with numerous accessories, gadgets and equipment.""* Or even, *""Freely customizable weapons simulation.""* Yeah, can we start to see some of this? Bullseye even had interchangeable sights.)
* Grenades, or equipment in general.
* Loadouts customisable from the menu (to allow selection of the above two. Primary, secondary (which would just be pistol for the time being) and equipment) That and player customisation in general. One of the ambitious goals is to let the player be their own Interstellar Marine, yes? We're still all... painfully normal. (*""Persistent character development and skill system.""*)
* DM on a map like Starcrown. Oddly specific, but the idea was DM muck around with no limitations on maps of the player's choice.
* Laser pointers with only the dot, not the strobe. Another specific, but the lasersight does more harm than good. Would be great if we could still see the strobe for allies, to see where they're aiming, because... tactics?

And then, some other things I've heard in passing for more general things that *might* help. I doubt it though. Stuff like leaning, map design that doesn't feel like you can be shot from anywhere, updating your website so the forum spam is fixed & the most recent thing isn't Sitrep 4, performance improvements, a melee to not kill but at least deter the people who spray & pray charge (and helps SP/COOP because bots) and just... performance improvements all around.

I know you guys are a small team. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that things are the way they are. I get it, one step at a time... but try to take the right steps in the right order. It's a little depressing that people don't have much of a reason to *stay* and keep playing. The game needs something to work towards, progression. The TR system is so... wow. Apparently you guys ARE working on a progression system, I've seen the prologue mockup... And frankly, it looks great. Put ALL your effort into that and everything that needs to surround that to make it work. Clearing missions, challenges and so on for unlocks seems great! But if the missions/challenges are painfully simple, few & far between, or even give lackluster rewards (""You've unlocked *1,000 TR points!*"" or ""You've unlocked an *emblem/achievement!*"") then it'll be a flop. IM is already on life support as it is in terms of fame & playing population, I've got no idea how the financial situation is, but again, goodluck.

okay, I am a tactical nerd and i am a big sucker for the feeling of being a spec op solider. hence why i am also a big fan of airsoft and such. the atmosphere in IM is what i have been looking for and what i got with airsoft, not only the shot matters. the sound. and amoung other things make this game so intense. and those are the awesome moments. ""i hear them under me, i walked down the stairs slowly while aiming. then took them out one by one. the voice tells me that the alarm is triggered. i quickly reload."" looking at that big cargo door while positioning myself that provide cover from the cargo door and the stairs direction i came from. they beached. i fire. took out 4 CTR, heard the dog on top opened, the gun's dry. switched to what they called a pistol. and then took out another 2 CTR.""

This is so AWESOME... i have that feeling of being a spec op!! okay. i think where IM shines is the large open map that i can pick my point of entry. while needing to complete secondary objectives in order to get to the main objective. i can see myself playing this ALOT, if everytime i load into the map, it is different weather, different patrol from the CTR, different position. different objective. IE: Take out the HVT, or rescue, or destroy.... (insert objective here). and maybe randomize our equipment, with one base pistols. (maybe lol). the most important. better CTR!!!! or maybe other enemies going on.

I'll try harder to wander around endlessly, searching, finding no other contestants and only opened & empty loot crates, only to be eliminated due to a low score.

...And I'll sure as hell try harder to wait several hours to join another server and do it all over again.

(Just to clarify, I have enjoyed the addition of Hell Week, and I'm sorry for sounding *salty* I guess. I appreciate the effort and work they've put into it, but I suppose I just needed to vent a little after several short lived attempts at trying to get some entertainment out of Hell Week. I do think there are a few issues with the accessibility of the concept and how much more enjoyment of the game it brings to the table, but I guess it's a stepping stone toward greater things...

9283,InterstellarMarines,"The assault rifle can't hit enemies that are are really close to you(in your face).I actually think this should stay in the final game!

So yeah, the assault rifle in this game cannot hit a droid that is very close to you as the model clips through the bot and shoots behind it-unless you back off a bit.   
Intentional or bug I do not know, but I feel this is actually a good balancing mechanic to encourage the SMG use vs melee enemies and balance the assault rifle as the ranged option.  
This is also realistic as when something is so close as to punch you(body to body), the length of the weapon really does play a role.Assault rifles and especially the one seen in the game are quite long.So if someone has approached you past the gun's barrel it is actually not easy to turn the gun and manage to shoot him when it's so long.  
You hAve to step back a bit, making the assault rifle a tad bit handicapped, only for melee enemies that have managed to rush you.

9322,InterstellarMarines,"What mods would *you* make?

If Interstellar Marines gets mod support, what would *you* make? Hostage rescue from the early Rainbow Six games? Bomb planting/disarming from Counter-Strike? America's Army type VIP extraction? Terrorist Hunt from the Rainbow Six Vegas series?


Personally, I'd love to make a mod like The Thing, where one of you is an enemy creature, indistinguishable from the rest.

.

**The Thing from outer space**

All players begin the game unarmed, grouped in twos and threes around the map. One players spawns as *The Thing*!

.

**Setup:**

Players spawn in twos and threes around the various parts of the facility. Players achieve victory by defeating *The Thing*. One player is informed that he is *The Thing*. He achieves victory once all players are eliminated or have been infected and finish gestating into more of *The Thing*.

.

**Play:**

Players begin with several chores (objectives) they must complete as part of their research on the station. Completing a chore will bring a reward, such as extra medical equipment, extra weapons, a backup generator, etc. As prerequisite chores are completed, new chores are awarded. Until all the prerequisite chores are completed, you do not know which chores are coming up. Damage to certain systems will make some chores impossible, and you may eventually run out of possible chores by this fact.

.

**The Thing:**

The Thing is an alien lifeform that can take the shape of living creatures. The Thing starts as helpless as any other human, and remains indistinguishable from other during its gestation period of several minutes. After its gestation completes, the creature gains superhuman endurance and the ability to infect other players.

.


**Environmental Interactivity:**

You're trapped in a station with various systems that can be activated/deactivated/destroyed. The medical lab can be set up to test your blood for the infection. (A player must perform several time-intensive tasks in the medical lab to set up the experiment, then players' blood can be tested.) The radio station can be used to call for help, tricking the hapless responders into permitting the creature to escape. (Sets a countdown timer, after which the creature wins if it has not been eliminated.) The infirmary can stabilize players who've been heavily injured and are ""bleeding out"", but it can be locked, damaged, or destroyed. (Must be damaged/destroyed from the inside.) The power can be destroyed, slowly freezing the humans to death. (They can win by destroying the creature before their time expires.) The armory can be locked/unlocked/destroyed, and keys distributed. (Players begin unarmed and defenseless, but a variety of weapons are available. Some simply kill things, a limited few can reveal the creature's nature if it is adequately injured.) If enough chores are completed, a preventative vaccine can be created in the medical lab (if it still exists!), or the entire station may be self-destructed, resulting in an automatic victory for the scientists over *The Thing*.


.


**Communication:**

Players may communicate by radio (visor down) or face-to-face (visor up). Radio communications are audible to *all* players, including *The Thing*. Face-to-face communication is limited in range, and works as demonstrated in the Interstellar Marines audio occlusion demo. Players wishing to plot in secret (or who wish to voice suspicions in private!) will have to use face-to-face communication, requiring physical proximity.

.

**Weaponry:**

Most weapons begin locked in the Armory. The Armory begins unlocked, but may be locked, unlocked, and destroyed. In addition to weapons which may be used to kill regularly, the Armory also includes a few flamethrowers, which reveal when a player is *The Thing* if they do adequate damage, or are used on a corpse. Additional flamethrowers and ammunition may be obtained by completing chores.


.


**Infection and Gestation:**

*The Thing* can infect players once it finishes gestating. Infection is a harmless (no damage) process, which takes place instantaneously. There is a very clear animation that shows when *The Thing* is infecting someone, so it is best to infect players alone and from behind. A player will not know he has been infected if he does not see himself get infected. Once a player is infected, he immediately begins gestating.

Gestation takes several minutes, and occurs in three phases. In the first phase, the player cannot be distinguished from other players by any means, including a blood test. One-third of the way through gestation, the player reaches the acute infection point, after which blood tests will confirm that the player is infected. Two-thirds of the way through infection, the player reaches the critical point. Once a player reaches the critical point, he is notified that he is infected, and his vision changes slightly to show him that he is infected. Once gestation completes, the player is *The Thing*, and can infect other players.

.

**Victory:**

The scientists win by defeating *The Thing,* and killing any infected players. *The Thing* wins by killing all scientists.

Players who have been infected (but have not finished gestating) count as scientists. Any infected player who dies *before* gestation completes wins and loses with the scientists. Thus, a player who has reached the critical point of gestation knows he must be killed, but is faced with the dilemma of whether he wants to win with the players or with *The Thing.*

.

.

9325,InterstellarMarines,"Starcrown Aerospace: Pioneering interplanetary space travel.

Originally founded by Bernard Matheus Crown in the early 21st century as a small fleet for the service of exclusive and affluent clients, Starcrown Aerospace has grown over the last 40 years into one of the largest commercial fleets in ITO‚Äôs airspace. At any given time, 83% of all active vessels belong or have been designed by them. Additionally, Starcrown Aerospace has placed a heavy focus on research and development since the passing of its founder in 2076, creating the conditions and technologies that assisted mankind in thriving throughout the Solar System. 

Bernard Crown has always had a fascination with flying. His father, Matheus Crown, was a pilot in the armed forces. When off duty, he would take his son with him to the aerodrome to fly with him on an old Cessna 172. Whilst other kids his age spent the weekends in front of computer screens, Bernard Crown was often flying with his father. Piloting became a hobby from early childhood. He had his private pilot license before graduating high school, and a commercial pilot license during college. 

He founded Crown Aerospace after graduating from Cambridge University in Applied Social Sciences. His father retired from the armed forces and became his first employee. Over the years, Starcrown Aerospace grew from a family-sized company, with a heavy focus on quality of service to the wealthy and powerful, to the behemoth of commercial airspace.

His last decades were of philanthropy and social responsibility, perhaps a reflection of his humanistic education in social sciences. After a lifetime of flying the skies, or ""stretching his wings"", as he would often put it, Crown believed a single planet was not sufficient to hold the spirit of mankind, it was time for humanity to join the alluring vastness of space. Working in close proximity with several of ITO's divisions, Bernard Crown elaborated a civilian colonisation plan that spread over half our home system, providing the required means of transportation for millions of civilians from all around the globe aboard, for example, the Aerobus 450F, one of the first-approved large-scale civilian transport ships and still the hallmark of civilian spaceflight today.

Although primarily a civilian aeronautics company, Starcrown Aerospace's role in advancing the colonisation of the Solar System, continuous collaboration with ITO, and the quality of technology developed by their research division, has provided this company with its fair share of government contracts, particularly in developing military-grade vessels, like the iconic Megalodon OPD-3A dropship.

[AUDIO LOG 1] Ruben Snyder 01

Attention to all crew, some of our benefactors from the neurogen pharma corporation are to use this facility on the 27th of this month. The purpose of this meeting is to increase their financial support to the vital work we're developing here. I here request that all service and maintenance personnel to perform a full check on the station's main systems and ready uniform in pristine condition. To the research teams, please provide updated reports on your work as soon as possible, for presentation and evaluation.

[AUDIO LOG 2] Sarah Magellan 01

Its always the same thing, doesn't matter whether your still in college or at top level private company. Something always goes missing. Honestly how does Doctor Barbero expect me to continue work when the supplies keep going missing.

[AUDIO LOG 3] Leo Stark 01

Doctor Sarah was right, someone is accessing the storage room taking supplies without signing them off. Whoever it is, only old time stamps left. I can't identify anything else. I'll ask Hank Choo to check on this and see if anyone altered the access mechanism but I'm still waiting for his report. I should notify Mr. Snyder about this.

[AUDIO LOG 4] Hank Choo 01

Leo Stark asked me to check on the access door to the storage room. Apparently someone has been accessing it without leaving any record of who's access card was used. The access mechanism is working fine and the manual override hasn't been used as far as I can tell. Given the circumstances I think someone got their hands on a skeleton key but the only people able to produce one would be: me, David Calru and Snyder. Still not sure if I should report this back to Mr. Lee or Mr. Snyder

[AUDIO LOG 5] William Barbero 01

Snyder just came around asking about the missing supplies from storage. Had to tell him about Dr. Magellan's latest break through and about the replication of the results. He became rather interested in my own side experiments, asking me to continue and not to worry about doc's investigation. Apparently hes contacting the ITO defense department are interested in this kind of research. Which means funding is no longer an issue, even if neurogen pulls the plug on us.

[AUDIO LOG 6] Leo Stark 02

Just finished reading Hank's and Choo's report. He can't find anything wrong with the access mechanism to the storage area. So I got no other option but to keep a close eye on this. To make matters worse, when I mentioned this event to Snyder. He said if I couldn't find anything else, I should just let it die. I can't do that,m I have an obligation to these people, there safety is my responsibility. If theres any foul play and it endangers the crew, I'll be crucified.

[AUDIO LOG 7] Hank Choo 02

Talking to Mr. Snyder about the storage situation seemed to expedite our next delivery. Neurogen headquarters is sending a coald mission 18 days ahead of schedule I'll have to send a team to clear the hangar bay for the extra supply we're getting but at least Kimmie will have a birthday gift in time this year, instead of having to wait for the usual delivery date despite all the hassle theres a silver lining. I really hope she likes it... I miss my little girl.

[AUDIO LOG 8] Sarah Magellan 02

Finally some progress! The subject has shown improvement in the profita test and sensorial memory after only 3 weeks of being administrated ""Anti-17"" compound on a daily basis. Most of the subjects also have shown intermittent explosive disorder. A behavioral disorder characterized by extreme expression of anger often to the point of a controlled rage. It is yet unclear if it the result of the lesions in the prefrontal cortex caused by the alzheimer's or if it is a side effect of the drug, we'll have to wait for the autopsy to make sure.

[AUDIO LOG 9] William Barbero 02

Dr. Magellan's latest results are quite promising, however, she did forget to mention some rather interesting side effects on a small percentage of the test sample. Some of the subjects exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to pain, increased aggressiveness and intermittent explosive disorder as reported previously by Dr. Magellan. On a special note the sample in the sample takes that aggression to rather extreme perpicks. I cobbled off the subjects forged channer to the point of inflicting lethal injuries on one another without stopping or diminishing the ferocity of the attacks.

[AUDIO LOG 10] Ellen Weaver 01

I've had to deal with more complaints than usual this week because of the communication restrictions... Adrub is correct in the pass of them. After our arrangement with the ITO, we must be very careful with the information we let slip to the outside. As these sent board of investors have had the opportunity to weight in on the matter I'm sure we agree on Rupert decision to let Doctor Barberos pursue his new avenue of research. Besides it'll surely provide much better profit we achieve by trading the sith key.

[AUDIO LOG 11] Sarah Magellan 03

Dr. Barbero has been moody as of late, since my last breakthrough, hes been so focused on his lab he barely takes a rest. I'm concern he'll soon enough have a nervous breakdown. I don't get it why hes acting like this. I mean I know the investor meeting is in a couple of days and the progress we've had is tremendous. I'm sure neurogen will continue to fund us. There is no need for this.

[AUDIO LOG 12] William Barbero 03

I've been replication Dr. Magellan's experiment and finally identified and isolated neurogenic prenos for the decreased sensitivity to pain. aggressiveness and reminiscences to shoot. One way to control this was to include an energy plutonic agent that increases sensibility to suggestion. The aggression is still there but the subjects can be more easily controlled by a third party. Also aerial dispersion of modified viral agent has proven to be just as effective as in its original formation and much simpler to apply. Just need to place samples on a closed environment and its ready.

As usual this time of year I rounded up all of the station's personnel including the patients and conducted the mandatory medical check up. Still how I hate it when people call me Dr. Bennerd its like the running joke when its time to draw some blood. REALLY? How difficult is it to say Dr. Miki Byen. Anyway the first lab works are complete and theres a potentially alarming result, Dr. Barbero's blood work is very similar to one of the patient Dakota Dakoo. One of the volunteers from ITO military fortunately I won't be able to report this to headquarters until communications are restored. While I notified Snyder about it, hopefully he'll take some safety measures.

[AUDIO LOG 14] Sarah Magellan 04

I just had to go and see Snyder. Willia uhhh Dr. Barberos behavior of late is starting to really concern me he no longer lets his research assistant in the lab and shuts anyone who even passes by. I hope Snyder can talk him into taking sometime off, he really needs it.

[AUDIO LOG 15] William Barbero 04

After all our staunt to bring it to the neurogen research department. That whiny little bitch went over my back to Rupert. What's it to her if I'm spending too much time in my lab. Its MY DAMN work. She wouldn't be so damn pinulated if I showed her my own progress. (long sigh) Maybe I should.

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 01] Sarah Magellan 01

Dr. Barbero keeps pushing hard on our work I don't understand why hes rushing this, I keep getting the same results and the equipment degrades faster. I wonder if the investor meeting in a few days has anything to do with it. Either way David is going to have to hurry back to the lab. At Least with Rupert supporting us, we won't have to wait for long

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 02] David Cutler 01

I'm really starting to loose my patience with this women. I know bloody well that her work is important but other people need their equipment as well. If it wasn't for Snyder pushing her to the top of the pile the other labs would be performing much better. Atleast shes much easier than doctor Barberos as of late. That man is becoming quite stressful to be around, he's spending too much time in the lab

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 03] Hank Choo 03

Another one of those seminars, I bet Cutler has been hating on the new research assistant. Awww that cute little redhead I mean that guy is good at what he does but damn he caught a horna. Soon enough either Snyder or neurogen is going to have him put in his own little cage. Come on little ape. Come on. Good boy. hahahahaha what a sight.

Okay, I've had the game for about a year now, playing occasionally with the updates. Obviously, I just got in and am playing the coop campaign. Now I have to ask, is the mission possible to beat? We got to the part that tells us to get to the room underneath the plant room (terrarium?) and we have been searching every nook and cranny of the station for the past 45 minutes and can't find anything. Its getting ridiculous. I was just informed we have 10 minutes remaining. How on Earth are we supposed to finish?

Update: I got into another game with someone who claims to have gotten past this part. He says there's supposed to be a key card in one of the crew bunks on the top level. However, we searched every single bunk and only found an audio log. The door he said he went through before was locked. Did the map glitch? I don't know. I give up for today.

Hey guys,

I've noticed that the sub is getting a little bigger so I'm making a call for people to mod the sub while I'm not on. I'm not generally on during the waking hours of the US so anyone in that general vicinity or timezone would be great. Anyone with some CSS knowledge would be great too just so we can make the sub a little prettier :D

PM me your details and I'll get to them in time.

I was pretty happy when I saw gameplay footage of this game and even happier when I bought it. What I didn't know was all the work that went into the background. I took a few hours recently to go through the website, look at the art, watch the videos, play the demos, etc. and I've come out with absolute adoration for the developers. If you're loosely part of the community, I urge you to take a look. You WILL be impressed.

As a student who spends a lot of free time working with Unity, I find all of this even more intriguing. I have so many questions for the developers about how they got things working.

It's hard to convey how happy I am to have paid for the Spearhead upgrade and supported this amazing team.

I am a big fan of the gameplay of Interstellar Marines because its a slower paced shooter. The speed of the game allows for a tactical approche ingame. All in all it somehow reminded me of Counter Strike, naturally i got really pumped when i read that they wanted to encourage professional gaming which means: good Anti Cheat, good hit detection and balanced weaponry and all that with a focus on realism (at least from a graphical point of view).

I am just interested if thats basically the reason for everyone currently playing or are you hoping for future updates for faster paced movement (sprint? oh god please no), the dynamic maps or what ever.

Generally I run the game at 60 fps but during the stutter it drops to 1-2 fps. The sound also has a significant stutter. The stutter seems to happen when bullets are sparking off objects, when lights turn on and off and when sounds such as gun shots and the announcer happen.

I myself hope that they will add jumping, just because it gives the feeling of being able to go places you would not have been without.

[Early accesss update 3 image](http://media.interstellarmarines.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/steamearlyaccess/interstellarmarines_early_access_update_3_small.jpg)

It‚Äôs time to bring out the ‚ÄúM‚Äù in maintenance update (sorry, we just had to)! 

This time we‚Äôve updated the game to the latest version of Unity (version 4.2) which have solved a few of our outstanding crash bugs and given us a slight performance increase on all platforms. But the big ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù news is that due to the huge support we‚Äôve received on Steam we‚Äôve added a few more people to the team which will help us get more beefy updates out the door sooon! 

Update #4 is planned for Friday next week (if everything goes according to our plans) and in this update we hope to bring you a new large outdoor map staged to simulate an atmospheric evacuation zone right at the heart of a moist swamp environment. We‚Äôll also be working on an initial profile implementation for your combat training stats and maybe we‚Äôll even throw in a small surprise from your subconscious... 

Improvements
UPDATED: game engine to Unity 4.2 (overall better performance) 

UPDATED: team with 2 new (old) members Reese and Heks (level designer and music composer) and increased office map size 

UPDATED: game to default to fullscreen native resolution on first startup (possibly fixes ""black screen on startup"" bug?) 

UPDATED: OpenGL shadow filtering so shadows on OSX are just as pretty as Windows 

UPDATED: better shadow casting performance 


Fixes

FIXED: GetThreadContext crash occurring on some Windows PCs 
REMOVED: temporary ""game crashes on quit"" hotfix

>Lone Survivor
I, Kim Haar J√∏rgensen (the primary creative force behind Interstellar Marines), am currently the only official developer working on the game. I can do almost everything, except programming, which I'm learning. 

>To be able to pay the bills at home, I'm currently working a full time job as ""Respiratory Handicap Helper"", which is both day and night shifts, allowing a fair amount of ""free"" time to work on Interstellar Marines.

>At the moment there is not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for Interstellar Marines, except the ultra clear ambitious vision of what Interstellar Marines will be once fully realized, some day.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines, until I go crazy or die trying or preferably manage to recreate, pickup, maintain traction, and conclude the game(s) envisioned.

>Update 27
The next short term goal is to finally get Update 27 out. Update 27 is centered mostly around expanding our combat sandbox arena called Wargames and fixing as many of our bugs as possible. (You can check our Trello page[trello.com] for progress and more details).

>In the long term the goals will be to get the game upgraded to Unity 5.6+ and make everything run smoother, be much more bug free, and prettier. This will allow us to expand in more interesting directions to chum players in.

>It's also a clear goal to make sure future updates, although small, will release more frequently.

>Moving forward
Lack of substantial progress in Early Access has resulted in a steady increase of negative reviews (understandably), which in turn have had a very serious effect on sales; creating a nasty downward spiral to the bottom of the foodchain.

>With the current negative review scores it will be much more difficult to attract publishers/investors to our game; although we will certainly still try. What‚Äôs more important is moving forward (even if slowly) and when things become more positive, more options will become available.

>I'll keep working on Interstellar Marines with awesome people interested in helping out, that's for sure. I've been very fortunate to get this small handful of awesome volunteer community members on board to help out from time to time.

Going to post this here, since their site won't even load right now for me lmao.

Dear Developers,

As someone who has had this game for a year and a half, bought eight copies for myself, friends, and family, and has been so unbelievably hyped for this game; I suggest you go and read the reviews section of your game on steam. A year ago, I think I recall it being positive, and now its' mixed. Yes, you know why? Because in ALL honesty, no hate or insults implied, this is the same game it was a year ago. One new map and a hunger games type game mode was refreshing, but after 2-4 hours of playing, you've seen it all. You improved the sounds, the animations, and fixed the numbers bugs that were around. Yes, and thank you, but all those give are momentary moments of glee. This game is transitioning into a war game like CS:GO, Insurgency, or Battlefield and is hardly the intense, strategically oriented, and team based game you CONTINUOUSLY make it out to be. I think myself, and most of your players, are SICK of seeing all these hot fixes that add nothing new to the game. You guys need to make a cup of coffee, pop some popcorn, and sit down around a PC and **READ** every review that's negative, because most of them make sense. 

You guys are focusing too much on the tiny nitty gritty bits of game making that is ruining it for many of your players. We want better guns, we want more **STEALTH** oriented maps, more levels that actually force us to watch each other's backs and keep a level of tense atmosphere. The NeuroGen Incident was so unbelievably fun the first time, but that's it, the first time. Maybe it lasted a week, a month, several months for some people, but it damn well won't last us much longer. The NeuroGen incident is the embodiment of everything you make this game out to be, and we want more of those kinds of maps guys. 

I'm no game developer, but I know that switching game engines will also delay the update process. Seriously, I think most gamers value mechanics over graphics. Some of the best games right now, have half the graphics newer but less popular games do. Counter-Strike is 15 year olds and then some and the newest edition is hardly a graphical improvement from Source, yet it's steam's most purchased game. Half-Life, the beloved masterpiece of Valve, has god awful graphics, and is still played today. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic has horrid graphics, but it's considered one of the best RPG games made and still has a decent player base for such an old game. Mechanics over graphics, will always make a game better. Please, straighten out your priorities with this game. We've had the same weapons for a year, with some minor tweaks. The same combat style more or less. We need updates on these aspects, and you guys have to deliver.

Also, while I have zero knowledge on the financial status of IM, I am pretty damn sure you guys have been well funded for 2015, and considering you don't have that many servers, or SEA servers it seems, I think your funds are mostly intact. Of course there are aspects I don't know about, but more or less, this game is earning. That fact will **stop** if you guys don't pick up the pace. IM is currently less playable than a game like Unturned, being developed by one person, who initially most likely earned less than IM due to it being a free game. Again, a game where graphics are trumped by mechanics. Please IM, more mechanics are long overdue for IM. 


Overall, I hope you guys haven't wasted the money of the thousands of people who have supported you. I'm not mad, just disappointed that such a great game concept looks like it'll never be finished. I pray and hope you boys prove me wrong, because I do wanna see IM as a finished, polished game, someday. 

If you really are community oriented, hopefully you'll accept criticism and use it to improve your product. ",2016-01-03 07:06:40,20,0,0.9977,1,1,1.0

9471,InterstellarMarines,"Where is this game even going?

I just got out of a match filled with team killing, cross-team teamspeak shenanigans to control entire rounds and straight up neglect for anyone wanting to actually play the game.

...And this is saddening, since there's only ever one multiplayer server decently filled up with players at a time. And multiplayer is the only entertaining (and I use that word lightly) thing to do, since SP and CO-OP have had their replay value wringed dry from the sponge that is this game.

I'm so sorry for being a negative nancy, but I really don't see where this game is headed. Or rather, I DO see what it's aiming for, but the path being taken to get there is just so... *Whuh?* A lot of minor features are being prioritised over what could be bigger, more entertaining core features. No, not campaign, I get that the game itself needs to be on a good foundation before a good campaign can even be conceived. And not co-op either, because if any more co-op is made with the way the game is now... it'll barely hold anyone's attention for more than a run or two. Hell, not even Landsharks or Mechs yet, I'd hate for two of the game's biggest shticks to be crammed in and sloppily done.

But I played a match yesterday, *almost* filled to capacity of the server, with people who I figured weren't too tightly knit with the community. I figured it'd be better to ask *the average player* what they thought the game REALLY needed right now (rather than the die-hard *BELIEVE* fan who'll talk your ear off about the game needing to be more realistic).

And summed up, they said:

* Weapons, for more variation. Sniper, DMR, shotgun, etc. (*""27 weapons along with numerous accessories, gadgets and equipment.""* Or even, *""Freely customizable weapons simulation.""* Yeah, can we start to see some of this? Bullseye even had interchangeable sights.)
* Grenades, or equipment in general.
* Loadouts customisable from the menu (to allow selection of the above two. Primary, secondary (which would just be pistol for the time being) and equipment) That and player customisation in general. One of the ambitious goals is to let the player be their own Interstellar Marine, yes? We're still all... painfully normal. (*""Persistent character development and skill system.""*)
* DM on a map like Starcrown. Oddly specific, but the idea was DM muck around with no limitations on maps of the player's choice.
* Laser pointers with only the dot, not the strobe. Another specific, but the lasersight does more harm than good. Would be great if we could still see the strobe for allies, to see where they're aiming, because... tactics?

And then, some other things I've heard in passing for more general things that *might* help. I doubt it though. Stuff like leaning, map design that doesn't feel like you can be shot from anywhere, updating your website so the forum spam is fixed & the most recent thing isn't Sitrep 4, performance improvements, a melee to not kill but at least deter the people who spray & pray charge (and helps SP/COOP because bots) and just... performance improvements all around.

I know you guys are a small team. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that things are the way they are. I get it, one step at a time... but try to take the right steps in the right order. It's a little depressing that people don't have much of a reason to *stay* and keep playing. The game needs something to work towards, progression. The TR system is so... wow. Apparently you guys ARE working on a progression system, I've seen the prologue mockup... And frankly, it looks great. Put ALL your effort into that and everything that needs to surround that to make it work. Clearing missions, challenges and so on for unlocks seems great! But if the missions/challenges are painfully simple, few & far between, or even give lackluster rewards (""You've unlocked *1,000 TR points!*"" or ""You've unlocked an *emblem/achievement!*"") then it'll be a flop. IM is already on life support as it is in terms of fame & playing population, I've got no idea how the financial situation is, but again, goodluck.

No, really. You need it.",2015-10-18 16:49:37,18,0,0.9937,1,1,1.0

I'll try harder to wander around endlessly, searching, finding no other contestants and only opened & empty loot crates, only to be eliminated due to a low score.

If you're loosely part of the community, I urge you to take a look. You WILL be impressed.

As a student who spends a lot of free time working with Unity, I find all of this even more intriguing. I have so many questions for the developers about how they got things working.

9542,InterstellarMarines,"What mods would *you* make?

If Interstellar Marines gets mod support, what would *you* make? Hostage rescue from the early Rainbow Six games? Bomb planting/disarming from Counter-Strike? America's Army type VIP extraction? Terrorist Hunt from the Rainbow Six Vegas series?


Personally, I'd love to make a mod like The Thing, where one of you is an enemy creature, indistinguishable from the rest.

.

**The Thing from outer space**

All players begin the game unarmed, grouped in twos and threes around the map. One players spawns as *The Thing*!

.

**Setup:**

Players spawn in twos and threes around the various parts of the facility. Players achieve victory by defeating *The Thing*. One player is informed that he is *The Thing*. He achieves victory once all players are eliminated or have been infected and finish gestating into more of *The Thing*.

.

**Play:**

Players begin with several chores (objectives) they must complete as part of their research on the station. Completing a chore will bring a reward, such as extra medical equipment, extra weapons, a backup generator, etc. As prerequisite chores are completed, new chores are awarded. Until all the prerequisite chores are completed, you do not know which chores are coming up. Damage to certain systems will make some chores impossible, and you may eventually run out of possible chores by this fact.

.

**The Thing:**

The Thing is an alien lifeform that can take the shape of living creatures. The Thing starts as helpless as any other human, and remains indistinguishable from other during its gestation period of several minutes. After its gestation completes, the creature gains superhuman endurance and the ability to infect other players.

.


**Environmental Interactivity:**

You're trapped in a station with various systems that can be activated/deactivated/destroyed. The medical lab can be set up to test your blood for the infection. (A player must perform several time-intensive tasks in the medical lab to set up the experiment, then players' blood can be tested.) The radio station can be used to call for help, tricking the hapless responders into permitting the creature to escape. (Sets a countdown timer, after which the creature wins if it has not been eliminated.) The infirmary can stabilize players who've been heavily injured and are ""bleeding out"", but it can be locked, damaged, or destroyed. (Must be damaged/destroyed from the inside.) The power can be destroyed, slowly freezing the humans to death. (They can win by destroying the creature before their time expires.) The armory can be locked/unlocked/destroyed, and keys distributed. (Players begin unarmed and defenseless, but a variety of weapons are available. Some simply kill things, a limited few can reveal the creature's nature if it is adequately injured.) If enough chores are completed, a preventative vaccine can be created in the medical lab (if it still exists!), or the entire station may be self-destructed, resulting in an automatic victory for the scientists over *The Thing*.


.


**Communication:**

Players may communicate by radio (visor down) or face-to-face (visor up). Radio communications are audible to *all* players, including *The Thing*. Face-to-face communication is limited in range, and works as demonstrated in the Interstellar Marines audio occlusion demo. Players wishing to plot in secret (or who wish to voice suspicions in private!) will have to use face-to-face communication, requiring physical proximity.

.

**Weaponry:**

Most weapons begin locked in the Armory. The Armory begins unlocked, but may be locked, unlocked, and destroyed. In addition to weapons which may be used to kill regularly, the Armory also includes a few flamethrowers, which reveal when a player is *The Thing* if they do adequate damage, or are used on a corpse. Additional flamethrowers and ammunition may be obtained by completing chores.


.


**Infection and Gestation:**

*The Thing* can infect players once it finishes gestating. Infection is a harmless (no damage) process, which takes place instantaneously. There is a very clear animation that shows when *The Thing* is infecting someone, so it is best to infect players alone and from behind. A player will not know he has been infected if he does not see himself get infected. Once a player is infected, he immediately begins gestating.

Gestation takes several minutes, and occurs in three phases. In the first phase, the player cannot be distinguished from other players by any means, including a blood test. One-third of the way through gestation, the player reaches the acute infection point, after which blood tests will confirm that the player is infected. Two-thirds of the way through infection, the player reaches the critical point. Once a player reaches the critical point, he is notified that he is infected, and his vision changes slightly to show him that he is infected. Once gestation completes, the player is *The Thing*, and can infect other players.

.

**Victory:**

The scientists win by defeating *The Thing,* and killing any infected players. *The Thing* wins by killing all scientists.

Players who have been infected (but have not finished gestating) count as scientists. Any infected player who dies *before* gestation completes wins and loses with the scientists. Thus, a player who has reached the critical point of gestation knows he must be killed, but is faced with the dilemma of whether he wants to win with the players or with *The Thing.*

.

9558,InterstellarMarines,"Simple goals for every new updates

The idea of this post is to make a list of simple things that would greatly improve the game. Ideally each new update would add 1 item to each categories.

* 1 weapon : pump action shotgun

 It's a gaming classic, it would work perfectly well in the IM universe, especially against CTR. 1 shot close range kill, with the drawback of slow rate of fire.

* 1 grenade : offensive grenade

 IM is *supposed* to be coop tactical, it's time to create the base for that. Add a grenade slot per player. Right now do a simple offensive grenade, that works well for everything.

* 1 equipment : explosive mine

 Once again, IM should be coop tactical (or at least tactical). Bring new pieces of equipment to add variety to the gameplay. As for the grenade, start with something simple such a mine, and expand from here.

* 1 mechanic : fluids

 Whenever a player would kill something at very close range, the target's bodily fluids (blood, oil...) would splash things, including the player's helmet. The more kill the dirtier your screen. You can then wipe them up by pressing a key. It's a simple gimmick that would reinforce the atmosphere.

* 1 map : Moon base.

 I don't care for hell week. Sadly it's the only way to play in new environments. Bring the maps from hell week to coop / TvT. It should be easy enough since the maps already exist, adapting them to other modes should be pretty simple.

Basically add 1 new item in each category for every new update. These should be simple goals that would quickly and easily expand IM's potential.

Example of other items for listed categories :

* weapons : sniper rifle, grenade launcher, LMG

* grenade : EMP, flashbang, healing grenade

* equipment : EMP mine, keycard tracker, door hacker (would allow to open doors from a distance), mine detector

* mechanic : melee, mag count (for realistic difficulty)

* map : all the maps from hell week

I'm sure there are other categories we could add to the list of things that are easy to do yet have a huge potential for the game. Feel free to add them if you think some other stuff should be listed. I didn't list new enemies because I feel these would require more work.

This is so AWESOME... i have that feeling of being a spec op!! okay. i think where IM shines is the large open map that i can pick my point of entry. while needing to complete secondary objectives in order to get to the main objective. i can see myself playing this ALOT, if everytime i load into the map, it is different weather, different patrol from the CTR, different position. different objective. IE: Take out the HVT, or rescue, or destroy.... (insert objective here). and maybe randomize our equipment, with one base pistols. (maybe lol). the most important. better CTR!!!! or maybe other enemies going on.

9561,InterstellarMarines,"Is there a reason the MP/PVP aspect of the game is taking the priority?

I was under the impression the game was first and foremost a coop horror/tactical game, and was to have a pvp aspect but not as a priority. 

And the reason there are more people playing the PVP currently (thorugh-out) is because there is basically nothing to the coop yet. 

So why is everything to do with ""hell week"" and seemingly no work is being done on the coop side of the game or atleast not reported about. 

If I could get a refund on this game I would. And I have owned it since day 1 all those years ago.....",2015-07-16 15:14:16,8,0,-0.7982,-1,-1,1.0

9566,InterstellarMarines,"The assault rifle can't hit enemies that are are really close to you(in your face).I actually think this should stay in the final game!

So yeah, the assault rifle in this game cannot hit a droid that is very close to you as the model clips through the bot and shoots behind it-unless you back off a bit.   
Intentional or bug I do not know, but I feel this is actually a good balancing mechanic to encourage the SMG use vs melee enemies and balance the assault rifle as the ranged option.  
This is also realistic as when something is so close as to punch you(body to body), the length of the weapon really does play a role.Assault rifles and especially the one seen in the game are quite long.So if someone has approached you past the gun's barrel it is actually not easy to turn the gun and manage to shoot him when it's so long.  
You hAve to step back a bit, making the assault rifle a tad bit handicapped, only for melee enemies that have managed to rush you.

[Early accesss update 3 image](http://media.interstellarmarines.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/steamearlyaccess/interstellarmarines_early_access_update_3_small.jpg)

It‚Äôs time to bring out the ‚ÄúM‚Äù in maintenance update (sorry, we just had to)! 

This time we‚Äôve updated the game to the latest version of Unity (version 4.2) which have solved a few of our outstanding crash bugs and given us a slight performance increase on all platforms. But the big ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù news is that due to the huge support we‚Äôve received on Steam we‚Äôve added a few more people to the team which will help us get more beefy updates out the door sooon! 

Update #4 is planned for Friday next week (if everything goes according to our plans) and in this update we hope to bring you a new large outdoor map staged to simulate an atmospheric evacuation zone right at the heart of a moist swamp environment. We‚Äôll also be working on an initial profile implementation for your combat training stats and maybe we‚Äôll even throw in a small surprise from your subconscious... 

Improvements
UPDATED: game engine to Unity 4.2 (overall better performance) 

UPDATED: team with 2 new (old) members Reese and Heks (level designer and music composer) and increased office map size 

UPDATED: game to default to fullscreen native resolution on first startup (possibly fixes ""black screen on startup"" bug?) 

UPDATED: OpenGL shadow filtering so shadows on OSX are just as pretty as Windows 

UPDATED: better shadow casting performance 


Fixes

FIXED: GetThreadContext crash occurring on some Windows PCs 
REMOVED: temporary ""game crashes on quit"" hotfix

 Hello everyone! I have been filming some consistent Interstellar Marines gameplay videos for almost a year now and I have decided to share it to the subreddit to give newcomers a feel for the game and maybe even pick up a few tactics and strategies along the way. It also boosts my channel's presence so that is always much appreciated :)

 Each episode incorporates 10-15 minutes of edited Interstellar Marines gameplay from a growing YouTuber and team manager of the Interstellar Marines Professional Team, Amorous Congress (myself!). They are posted weekly on Thursday at 6AM Eastern Standard Time and will always include a trivia question from the Interstellar Marines universe and last episode's winner. Viewers are always allowed to add me on steam unless their account looks spammy, and everyone is free to join the game while I am filming! 

 I hope you all enjoy this series as much as I love making it, and I look forward to bringing you along for the ride that is Interstellar Marines!

9598,InterstellarMarines,"Starcrown Aerospace: Pioneering interplanetary space travel.

Originally founded by Bernard Matheus Crown in the early 21st century as a small fleet for the service of exclusive and affluent clients, Starcrown Aerospace has grown over the last 40 years into one of the largest commercial fleets in ITO‚Äôs airspace. At any given time, 83% of all active vessels belong or have been designed by them. Additionally, Starcrown Aerospace has placed a heavy focus on research and development since the passing of its founder in 2076, creating the conditions and technologies that assisted mankind in thriving throughout the Solar System. 

Bernard Crown has always had a fascination with flying. His father, Matheus Crown, was a pilot in the armed forces. When off duty, he would take his son with him to the aerodrome to fly with him on an old Cessna 172. Whilst other kids his age spent the weekends in front of computer screens, Bernard Crown was often flying with his father. Piloting became a hobby from early childhood. He had his private pilot license before graduating high school, and a commercial pilot license during college. 

He founded Crown Aerospace after graduating from Cambridge University in Applied Social Sciences. His father retired from the armed forces and became his first employee. Over the years, Starcrown Aerospace grew from a family-sized company, with a heavy focus on quality of service to the wealthy and powerful, to the behemoth of commercial airspace.

His last decades were of philanthropy and social responsibility, perhaps a reflection of his humanistic education in social sciences. After a lifetime of flying the skies, or ""stretching his wings"", as he would often put it, Crown believed a single planet was not sufficient to hold the spirit of mankind, it was time for humanity to join the alluring vastness of space. Working in close proximity with several of ITO's divisions, Bernard Crown elaborated a civilian colonisation plan that spread over half our home system, providing the required means of transportation for millions of civilians from all around the globe aboard, for example, the Aerobus 450F, one of the first-approved large-scale civilian transport ships and still the hallmark of civilian spaceflight today.

Although primarily a civilian aeronautics company, Starcrown Aerospace's role in advancing the colonisation of the Solar System, continuous collaboration with ITO, and the quality of technology developed by their research division, has provided this company with its fair share of government contracts, particularly in developing military-grade vessels, like the iconic Megalodon OPD-3A dropship.

9652,InterstellarMarines,"Interstellar Marines: Why do we play it?

I am a big fan of the gameplay of Interstellar Marines because its a slower paced shooter. The speed of the game allows for a tactical approche ingame. All in all it somehow reminded me of Counter Strike, naturally i got really pumped when i read that they wanted to encourage professional gaming which means: good Anti Cheat, good hit detection and balanced weaponry and all that with a focus on realism (at least from a graphical point of view).

I am just interested if thats basically the reason for everyone currently playing or are you hoping for future updates for faster paced movement (sprint? oh god please no), the dynamic maps or what ever.

Tell me your Story, i just want to hear your reason why your interested in the game.

I've only been playing for about two weeks now, but I've noticed a bit of a pattern in the multiplayer games I've joined. Often times, each team will quickly capture the closest points to their respective spawns. While I know capping is a huge part of winning a match, I think it might be better for the team to wait on capping the closer points, the ones that are almost guaranteed for each team to own. Capping even thirty seconds later will be able to bring back team mates that died early, and possibly give your team more of an advantage. What do you guys thing?

Okay, I've had the game for about a year now, playing occasionally with the updates. Obviously, I just got in and am playing the coop campaign. Now I have to ask, is the mission possible to beat? We got to the part that tells us to get to the room underneath the plant room (terrarium?) and we have been searching every nook and cranny of the station for the past 45 minutes and can't find anything. Its getting ridiculous. I was just informed we have 10 minutes remaining. How on Earth are we supposed to finish?

Update: I got into another game with someone who claims to have gotten past this part. He says there's supposed to be a key card in one of the crew bunks on the top level. However, we searched every single bunk and only found an audio log. The door he said he went through before was locked. Did the map glitch? I don't know. I give up for today.

We'd randomly choose Squad Leader(who would also act as Alpha leader when the squad splits) and Bravo leader.

[AUDIO LOG 1] Ruben Snyder 01

Attention to all crew, some of our benefactors from the neurogen pharma corporation are to use this facility on the 27th of this month. The purpose of this meeting is to increase their financial support to the vital work we're developing here. I here request that all service and maintenance personnel to perform a full check on the station's main systems and ready uniform in pristine condition. To the research teams, please provide updated reports on your work as soon as possible, for presentation and evaluation.

[AUDIO LOG 2] Sarah Magellan 01

Its always the same thing, doesn't matter whether your still in college or at top level private company. Something always goes missing. Honestly how does Doctor Barbero expect me to continue work when the supplies keep going missing.

[AUDIO LOG 3] Leo Stark 01

Doctor Sarah was right, someone is accessing the storage room taking supplies without signing them off. Whoever it is, only old time stamps left. I can't identify anything else. I'll ask Hank Choo to check on this and see if anyone altered the access mechanism but I'm still waiting for his report. I should notify Mr. Snyder about this.

[AUDIO LOG 4] Hank Choo 01

Leo Stark asked me to check on the access door to the storage room. Apparently someone has been accessing it without leaving any record of who's access card was used. The access mechanism is working fine and the manual override hasn't been used as far as I can tell. Given the circumstances I think someone got their hands on a skeleton key but the only people able to produce one would be: me, David Calru and Snyder. Still not sure if I should report this back to Mr. Lee or Mr. Snyder

[AUDIO LOG 5] William Barbero 01

Snyder just came around asking about the missing supplies from storage. Had to tell him about Dr. Magellan's latest break through and about the replication of the results. He became rather interested in my own side experiments, asking me to continue and not to worry about doc's investigation. Apparently hes contacting the ITO defense department are interested in this kind of research. Which means funding is no longer an issue, even if neurogen pulls the plug on us.

[AUDIO LOG 6] Leo Stark 02

Just finished reading Hank's and Choo's report. He can't find anything wrong with the access mechanism to the storage area. So I got no other option but to keep a close eye on this. To make matters worse, when I mentioned this event to Snyder. He said if I couldn't find anything else, I should just let it die. I can't do that,m I have an obligation to these people, there safety is my responsibility. If theres any foul play and it endangers the crew, I'll be crucified.

[AUDIO LOG 7] Hank Choo 02

Talking to Mr. Snyder about the storage situation seemed to expedite our next delivery. Neurogen headquarters is sending a coald mission 18 days ahead of schedule I'll have to send a team to clear the hangar bay for the extra supply we're getting but at least Kimmie will have a birthday gift in time this year, instead of having to wait for the usual delivery date despite all the hassle theres a silver lining. I really hope she likes it... I miss my little girl.

[AUDIO LOG 8] Sarah Magellan 02

Finally some progress! The subject has shown improvement in the profita test and sensorial memory after only 3 weeks of being administrated ""Anti-17"" compound on a daily basis. Most of the subjects also have shown intermittent explosive disorder. A behavioral disorder characterized by extreme expression of anger often to the point of a controlled rage. It is yet unclear if it the result of the lesions in the prefrontal cortex caused by the alzheimer's or if it is a side effect of the drug, we'll have to wait for the autopsy to make sure.

[AUDIO LOG 9] William Barbero 02

Dr. Magellan's latest results are quite promising, however, she did forget to mention some rather interesting side effects on a small percentage of the test sample. Some of the subjects exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to pain, increased aggressiveness and intermittent explosive disorder as reported previously by Dr. Magellan. On a special note the sample in the sample takes that aggression to rather extreme perpicks. I cobbled off the subjects forged channer to the point of inflicting lethal injuries on one another without stopping or diminishing the ferocity of the attacks.

[AUDIO LOG 10] Ellen Weaver 01

I've had to deal with more complaints than usual this week because of the communication restrictions... Adrub is correct in the pass of them. After our arrangement with the ITO, we must be very careful with the information we let slip to the outside. As these sent board of investors have had the opportunity to weight in on the matter I'm sure we agree on Rupert decision to let Doctor Barberos pursue his new avenue of research. Besides it'll surely provide much better profit we achieve by trading the sith key.

[AUDIO LOG 11] Sarah Magellan 03

Dr. Barbero has been moody as of late, since my last breakthrough, hes been so focused on his lab he barely takes a rest. I'm concern he'll soon enough have a nervous breakdown. I don't get it why hes acting like this. I mean I know the investor meeting is in a couple of days and the progress we've had is tremendous. I'm sure neurogen will continue to fund us. There is no need for this.

[AUDIO LOG 12] William Barbero 03

I've been replication Dr. Magellan's experiment and finally identified and isolated neurogenic prenos for the decreased sensitivity to pain. aggressiveness and reminiscences to shoot. One way to control this was to include an energy plutonic agent that increases sensibility to suggestion. The aggression is still there but the subjects can be more easily controlled by a third party. Also aerial dispersion of modified viral agent has proven to be just as effective as in its original formation and much simpler to apply. Just need to place samples on a closed environment and its ready.

[AUDIO LOG 13] Miki Byen 01

As usual this time of year I rounded up all of the station's personnel including the patients and conducted the mandatory medical check up. Still how I hate it when people call me Dr. Bennerd its like the running joke when its time to draw some blood. REALLY? How difficult is it to say Dr. Miki Byen. Anyway the first lab works are complete and theres a potentially alarming result, Dr. Barbero's blood work is very similar to one of the patient Dakota Dakoo. One of the volunteers from ITO military fortunately I won't be able to report this to headquarters until communications are restored. While I notified Snyder about it, hopefully he'll take some safety measures.

[AUDIO LOG 14] Sarah Magellan 04

I just had to go and see Snyder. Willia uhhh Dr. Barberos behavior of late is starting to really concern me he no longer lets his research assistant in the lab and shuts anyone who even passes by. I hope Snyder can talk him into taking sometime off, he really needs it.

[AUDIO LOG 15] William Barbero 04

After all our staunt to bring it to the neurogen research department. That whiny little bitch went over my back to Rupert. What's it to her if I'm spending too much time in my lab. Its MY DAMN work. She wouldn't be so damn pinulated if I showed her my own progress. (long sigh) Maybe I should.

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 01] Sarah Magellan 01

Dr. Barbero keeps pushing hard on our work I don't understand why hes rushing this, I keep getting the same results and the equipment degrades faster. I wonder if the investor meeting in a few days has anything to do with it. Either way David is going to have to hurry back to the lab. At Least with Rupert supporting us, we won't have to wait for long

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 02] David Cutler 01

I'm really starting to loose my patience with this women. I know bloody well that her work is important but other people need their equipment as well. If it wasn't for Snyder pushing her to the top of the pile the other labs would be performing much better. Atleast shes much easier than doctor Barberos as of late. That man is becoming quite stressful to be around, he's spending too much time in the lab

RANDOM [AUDIO LOG 03] Hank Choo 03

Another one of those seminars, I bet Cutler has been hating on the new research assistant. Awww that cute little redhead I mean that guy is good at what he does but damn he caught a horna. Soon enough either Snyder or neurogen is going to have him put in his own little cage. Come on little ape. Come on. Good boy. hahahahaha what a sight.

9772,InterstellarMarines,"Anyone else getting an insane amount of stutter?

Ever since I think update 8(?) I have had a large amount of stutter during gameplay. I enjoyed playing the game before then but ever since the update I have only played for about 10 mins at a time because the stutter is so bad. Generally I run the game at 60 fps but during the stutter it drops to 1-2 fps. The sound also has a significant stutter. The stutter seems to happen when bullets are sparking off objects, when lights turn on and off and when sounds such as gun shots and the announcer happen. 

This is a great game and I can see the amazing potential in it and would love to play. Has anyone else experienced this and have any advice to rectify it? Thanks for any help. ",2014-07-05 10:04:29,2,0,0.9545,1,1,1.0

9774,InterstellarMarines,"Content creators for collab youtube series

Greetings fellow IM players. Do you make youtube videos? Then you might be what we are looking for. I'm currently looking for fellow content creators for collab series in IM multiplayer. This particular collab requires quite ""few"" people and is going to be difficult one to pull off to time it up with everything so don't expect quick videos!

First things first:

1. You have to have atleast few videos on your channel. Your sub or view amount doesn't matter aslong as you actually create content. Everyone has to do their own recording & editing. Streaming WON'T be allowed/acceptable in most cases due the nature of format.

2. You have to have decent microphone, due the nature of collab you need to have microphone that doesn't compremise everyone elses audio in team setup. It doesn't need to be expensive one, just good enough not to ruin the audio for everyone else. 

3. Own legimate copy of Interstellar Marines. I'm not going to give you one and you won't be able to participate with pirated copy.

If you fulfill these three requirements and are intrested of joining the collab, hit me up on steam or in this topic. I'll have few questions prepared and more information what's going on.

9805,InterstellarRift,"Public Service Announcement

Public Service Announcement:

So after spending a lot of time, resources, money and close calls I lost my prize ship today. It was 125 blocks in length, 45 blocks in width 2 x drone bays, 2 x Large Shields, 1 x Station Shield, cloak over 600,000 k hydrogen tank capacity for extended trips, ship storage system, armed to the teeth, 4 x refineries, 4 x extractors complete multipurpose ship. Well over 5.5 mil to insure (didn't insure it  couldn't afford to)

&#x200B;

So why is this a public service announcement? Well after surviving an onslaught of Skrill with torpedo's and missiles in a T3 system I rifted into a relatively safe T2 system to do some mining and collect resources, refuel etc. Parked at the mining station, activated station shields, deployed drones, started extracting water to make fuel for my 4 x Extra Large Hydrogen tanks.

&#x200B;

10 x Skrill attack, my weapons are dropping their numbers but my station shield is not online (10 min to go), so I turn off the shield and start running, manage to destroy them all then get back to my parking spot. Engage station shield and start doing repairs etc. After 9 minutes I hear guns, thinking oh more skrill, next my shields are going down I jump to the cockpit no skrill??? WTF??? see a swarm of protection drones all red around me shooting me. Did I leave my guns on? Did I accidently shoot the station? No to both my guns were off I was 800 m from station so why are these drones attacking me??!!???! I attempt to run, call for repair drones to repair the ship but more drones arrive only to attack me and worse they took my credits so WTF I paid to be attacked? No it wasn't a reputation issue I was at 3500 rep for my faction and around 1500 for all the other factions. So after freaking out I ran around the ship and noticed the Skrill had infected my ship with their internal creatures. After removing them the drones continued to attack me, apparently awaiting the cooldown timer, so once again I request repairs from the service....cost me 4.5 million for the service call. Guess what more drones appeared and started attacking me needless to say I died, my ship was destroyed and now am broke sitting in the station going WTF just happened.

&#x200B;

So long story short what I have learned and am guessing the issue was if your ship is infected by the Skrill, the AI considers you as an enemy and will attack you so anytime you are attacked and your shields go down, do yourself a favor stay away from stations until you have done a complete check of your ship for the internal parasites otherwise you will end up in the same situation I was in getting attacked and not knowing why.

&#x200B;

Will I recover? Absolutely I have another great ship in another system in storage and I have always dumped my high value resources into my vault or my freighter then store my ship in the station for protection.

&#x200B;

Long slow process to get to where I was but just the nature of the game, you can't always win and sometimes it takes a good asskicking to get your head straight. That is my Public Service Announcement.",2021-02-24 19:02:24,7,0,-0.9979,-1,-1,1.0

Hey ya all. Quick question with long explanation.

We all know that later in game making specialised ships isn't really useful. We got materials, we got money, we got all we need in quantities wchich exceed usage. So, this question will be divided into two questions.

1. At early game, do you think it's better to specialize ships to avoid some costs, like fuel and materials?
2. Later in game, do you specialize your ships? For example, for convienience (so you don't have to run miles around ship), cost (fuel, coolant etc.) or to avoid potential cost of loosing said ship? (PvP)

I am just curious. And I tend to specialize my ships in both cases, because I like building them so yeah. But what about you all?",2020-11-23 15:53:38,6,0,0.61,1,1,1.0

I'm really liking what I'm seeing so far but have a few questions:

Does it support 3440x1440 resolution?

How big is the map/universe?

Is there a single player or do you need to join or create a multiplayer server?

If I did join a server can I use my character/ship in another server?

9838,InterstellarRift,"Changes to the Event Horizon IsR server

IsR 1.0 is launching on September 24th. In an attempt to capitalize on the increased player traffic that the launch will (hopefully) bring, there are going to be considerable changes to how Event Horizon ([http://event-horizon.site](http://event-horizon.site), [https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) operates. This includes a full wipe of the main EH server, though players won't necessarily be starting over with zero resources (more details on that below).

The goals of these changes are to encourage longer term player retention, encourage more regular player interactions (both PvE and PvP interactions), and to give long term goals/achievements for players and organizations. 

These changes will include (but are not necessarily limited to):

‚Ä¢Fewer star systems in the EH galaxy (currently looking at about 4-6 ""useful"" systems in total).

‚Ä¢A new central star system (Hadron) that all players will start in.

‚Ä¢Limited resource spawns in the asteroid belts (both of type and quantity).

‚Ä¢Seasons of PvP and PvE (though there will be one permanent PvE star system, and one permanent PvP star system).

‚Ä¢Addition of randomly spawning, short lived, asteroid fields; same as the ones that spawn at NPC mining stations. Note that these fields will have more than just T0 resources. These will spawn in random locations, encouraging players to seek them out and compete with other groups to mine them.

‚Ä¢Return of server events, such as PvP tournaments, but also PvE events.

‚Ä¢A new unique currency (Eventium) on the server, represented by a custom resource. Players can earn this currency in various ways, including trading with/stealing from other players. Players will be able to trade Eventium in for other resources, but they will also be able to use it to purchase custom stations, purchase special services, or use it to purchase resources after the wipes. Automated scripts will be in place to help with many of these Eventium transactions, which will hopefully allow it to be considerably more useful. 

Not all of these changes will be present on Event Horizon as soon as 1.0 launches, and are subject to change based on what 1.0 adds and how many players EH can attract with the 1.0 launch. The current EH server will continue as is until the 24th, and will probably still be left online, at least temporarily, after the 1.0 launch. The new server will simply take its place on the 24th.

(Potentially) Frequently Asked Questions:

*Why are you wiping the server? I don't want to start over again!*

The server wipe does two things: the first (and primary) reason is that it allows me to create a new IsR server and work on setting it up over the next few weeks, without needing to worry about preserving/transferring/losing player progress. The second reason is that it's encouraging for new players to know that everyone else on the server don't have a massive advantage over them; and for many existing players it's more engaging to have a fresh start. 

That said, I know starting completely over in IsR can be a bit of a grind, so starter packs will be given out to existing players, based on how long they've been on the Discord. If you left the Discord and then came back later on, I'll still count it. The exact amount and type of resources in the starter packs has yet to be decided, but it will be based on the tier system. 2+ years equals T3, 1+ year equals T2, 6+ months equals T1, and anyone arriving before the launch of 1.0 will get some T0 resources. More details on that can be found on the EH Discord ([https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) leading up to the 1.0 launch.

*Why are you having so few star systems, other servers have hundreds!*

The huge number of star systems that IsR spawns by default is actually a problem with IsR, even if you assume a server regularly has 64 players (something that has never happened). Star systems in IsR are already so enormous that you could put the full 64 players in a single star system, remove signatures and transponders, and it would be practically impossible to find another player. Even in Vectron Syx on popular servers the only time you'll run into another player is when they're back at HSC IC to rearm/store their ship. The rest of the time players are scattered across the stars. On a server with even 50 star systems PvP is practically impossible, and even just trying to meet up with other players to trade with/crew with them is a chore.   
Having infinite star systems also equals infinite resources, which completely removes any reason to interact with other players for resources. Why trade with/fight with other players for resources when you can just as easily (or even easier) mine them yourself by finding a system with a high rating of your target resource?

*What special services?*  
Good question. I haven't thought of very many at the moment, it would be things like allowing players to rename planets/stars, and to have the Skrill/faction rating of a system adjusted. I'm sure players will give me other ideas as we go forwards.  
*PvP/PvE seasons?*  
This is an idea I acquired from other Empyrion servers during that brief period where I hosted an Emp server for EH (apologies to those players who wanted such a server for longer, it proved to be more effort than I was willing to give, especially as Empyrion was a game I didn't find very engaging).  
The star systems on Event Horizon will cycle between majority PvE and majority PvP toggle on a regular cycle. If you're not interested in engaging in PvP, you can still play on Event Horizon, but PvP players will get bonus Eventium and other rewards for beating other groups. There will also be changes to encourage raids of other org's stations during PvP seasons.

  
*""After the wipes""? What wipes?*

This is the one change I'm not fully decided on. I'm considering having the server wipe every so often, with a handful of things carrying over, like Eventium. I'm not fully convinced that the benefits of this outweigh the downsides, but at minimum these wipes would only take place every 6 months at the minimum; most likely even rarer.

Hi all, I have a ship design request. I REALLY suck at creativity and designing ship hulls, but I can really do great work with a ship's internals if I'm given a space to work with. Would some kind soul find enjoyment out of replicating the Covenant Heavy Corvette that we get to board in Halo: Reach? It should be a large ship, capable of holding large internals like the rift generator, shield generators, nuclear reactor, and 1 or 2 drone bays as the ""hanger"". Hopefully, it's not so big that it's cargo and stored ship(s) (stored in the ""Private Ship Storage"" module) won't exceed the capabilities of a large rift generator.

I would REALLY appreciate a mostly accurate model, and I'd get a ton of enjoyment out of outfitting the ship's internals.

Event Horizon is having a design contest to pick a ""replacement"" design for The Black Pit.

Contest will end in about six weeks, but may be longer depending on how long it takes me to get my act together with the new server.Who: anyone who can build a station that isn't an eyesore.Reward: I'll get back to you on that. (There will be a reward of some sort, but I haven't had the time to put thought into what exactly.)Special Instructions: In order to ensure that nothing is broken, your new station must be built alongside the Black Pit. What this means is you need to load the Black Ship file, move over 20 squares, and start your design there. Players can use teleporters to cross from the original Black Pit to the new station.Design Requirements: the station needs to be easily navigated, no endless hallways. Need two large mining bays, similar to those on the HSC IC. No ACTRs, however make sure the new station has all the standard NPC terminals, as well as mission boards and drop boxes. 3D printers and assemblers are up to you as to whether or not you want to include them. Having an ""admin"" room with a transponder and a shield generator would be appreciated, but not necessarily required.You can use the following file to start with. MAKE SURE YOU START WITH THE FOLLOWING DESIGN AND MAKE NO CHANGES TO ITS INTERNALS. If you'd like to make changes to the exterior of the original Black Pit, i.e. ""attaching"" the two designs together with exterior blocks, that is acceptable.

## Heist Aboard the Trafalgar

Echelon Company reports that one of their ships was found to have been boarded, looted and damaged late on the 9th of June. Could this be the result of independent hackers, or was it an inside job? Interstellar Newsline is here reporting on the investigation.

The Trafalgar is Echelon Company‚Äôs only active warship and was in the process of conducting long term nuclear reactor trials in an attempt to breed superior nuclear fuels, according to one EC representative. The stolen goods amount to over 30 U-238, 15 Pu-239, 1 Pu-241, 100 standard torpedos, 50 rounds of railgun bolts and 10 T3 heat sinks. Estimates of the value of goods lost put the cost between 100 and 125 Million units and damages in excess of 800,000 units.

Echelon Company stated that the Trafalgar has been put back into service as a combat vessel for escort and stealth operations. Prior to the incident the fuel was intended to fuel EC‚Äôs interests over the next few weeks as they industrialize and improve their ship building capabilities. Echelon Company declined to comment on suspects of the heist, but had the following to say: ‚ÄúI implore independent pilots and faction aligned pilots alike to develop \[their\] own security protocols for \[their ships\] if \[they\] are unable to store them in a station.‚Äù

## Traffic Collision Results in Destroyed Ship at HSC Industrial Complex

Monday, June 10th

Echelon Company lost a ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù class industrial ship today following a traffic collision at the HSC Industrial Complex in Vectron Syx.

The Commodore was parked at the HSC Industrial Complex and was collided into by a Quartermaster class industrial ship piloted by Turkey Sandvich, CEO of the Long-Limb Roe Acquisition Specialists faction. Station police records show that Mr. Sandvich has been involved in numerous collision incidents at the station in the past, but never any that resulted in the destruction of a ship. A police representative stated that the station telemetry recorded that the damage which was done only amounted to 6HP. This indicates that the destroyed ship was already in a very weakened state or had its defensive systems offline prior to the collision.

Mr. Sandvich stated that ‚Äúderelicts should not be parked in a congested area like that around the HSC station. It could pose a danger to any parking ships if they were to explode like this one.‚Äù The two involved parties have settled the matter privately.

## Materials Lost Aboard the AprilDan and her Sister Ship

Another two Echelon Company ships this week were looted while mining cloaked in deep space.

Materials lost aboard both ships amount to at least 7.5 Million Units in T3 materials and ammo. Nuclear rods and hydrogen had to be replaced and damage was sustained due to a skrill attack following the theft according to the Echelon Company Public Information Office. When asked about potential suspects, a statement made by the office stated: ‚ÄúWe have no clue who could have found us to do this.  We have locked all company vaults to only company officers.‚Äù

The ECPIO further stated that both ships have been put back into service to replace the lost fuel rods and materials and said ‚ÄúBoth ships are in space dock hopefully engineers and IT specialists can help identify the guilty party.  Justice will be swift in league with the old ‚ÄòShock and Awe‚Äô type of retribution.‚Äù

S3 investigators looking into the theft commented that the ship‚Äôs logs show that one of the ship‚Äôs cloaking devices was disrupted by the launch of a mining drone. This could have allowed a hacker to find the ship and gain access to steal the materials. They went on to state, however, that they are not ruling out the possibility of an inside-job at this time.

In the wake of multiple ship robberies and thefts this week, Interstellar News would like to remind pilots that proper storage of ships is a key to security. Hackers and traitors are all around us and the possibility for theft is always present. If you can‚Äôt afford to lose it, don‚Äôt leave it sitting around!",2019-06-15 19:54:30,8,0,-0.9867,-1,-1,1.0
9852,InterstellarRift,"Interstellar Rift Player Designed Ships Contest 003 - The Lone Wanderers

**It‚Äôs been a while since the last ship design contest, but we‚Äôre happy  to announce a new one. The contest will coincide with the next patch  (0.2.9) which will introduce derelict ships. We will be designing the  bulk of these, but to help us fill out the variety of vessels to  encounter, we need your help! This time we‚Äôll be electing multiple  winners, with 5 ships going into the game this time.**  


As the  previous contests only had a single winner, if you want a ship you  designed to be in the game, this is going to be one of the best chances  you‚Äôll get.   


The ships we‚Äôd like to see are smaller vessels, with  some cargo capacity, and an interesting interior layout, made up of  multiple corridors and rooms so players can explore them.   


Ship description:  
The  ships should be smaller rather than large, as we‚Äôd like these ships to  be explorable in a fairly short amount of time. The ship‚Äôs systems  should function normally, once you encounter one of these ships in the  game, we will dynamically damage some of the devices and place loot on  board. These ships can be made to fit with a certain faction, but we  have no style guide, and you are free to design the exterior to your  liking. You are allowed to use devices from all tiers, as the ships will  spawn in systems relative to the resources used in construction.  


Creating  interesting ways to navigate the ship to get to the loot areas, or  setting up puzzle like power systems to gain access is encouraged.   


Requirements:  
Ship requirements:

* At least 3 rooms.
* At least 2 cargo pads (or a minimum of 16 cargo slots)
* At least 1 locker (or a minimum of 8 tool slots)
* The ship should function normally, no permissions have to be set on devices.
* At least 1 teleporter
* Ship mass can not be more than 100K.  
Things not to do:  
No admin models.  
No holes or traps that can get players stuck.

Contest Rules:  
As with every contest there are rules and regulations that everyone must adhere to so here are ours.

* All submissions must be original, ships resembling established designs outside of Interstellar Rift will be disqualified
* The  contest will run until the 18th of June, any submission made after the  end date will be disqualified. We will be looking at the ships on the  Developer Stream on the 19th of June. 
* All Submissions may  NOT contain and of the following, graphic or sexually oriented imagery.  any depictions of or related to drug use, political views outside of  those present inside of Interstellar Rift. 
* Split Polygon reserves the right to alter any winning submission before implementing it into the game. 
* The contest is open to anyone.

9855,InterstellarRift,"Creative Server PvP Event, by the person who brought you Event Horizon

On Saturday, June 8th at 14:00 EST (+4 UTC) I'll be hosting a PvP event on the Event Horizon Interim server (thanks to CrazyDeviant for hosting). If you'd like to participate, please join the EH Discord ([https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW](https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW)) and see #announcements. If you have other questions about the event, you can also ask them there.  
**You do not have to be an existing Event Horizon player to participate.** This event will be taking place on a creative server, and you will be allowed to spawn in your ship designs and whatever ammo and resource you need to power it before the event starts. *The server will have creative mode turned* ***off*** *as soon as the event begins. Make sure your ship and whatever resources you need have already been spawned by then. You'll likely find* /giveallres *an useful command for this. The server is online right now and will stay so through the event, so you should have plenty of time to prepare.*  
If you don't have any PvP ship designs or don't think you'd make a good pilot, you can still easily participate as a boarding party member.  
I will also be running logging tools during the event to help the developers optimize combat on IsR servers. The more players who participate, the more data SplitPolygon can glean from the event.   
**Event Details**  
Participants will be divided among three teams, each with their own nearly invulnerable (but hack-able and board-able) station. A neutral central station will be producing **the Spice** at regular intervals. You'll need to hack the station, gather as much **Spice** as you can carry, and bring it back to your team's station. Alternatively you can attack the other teams' ships and stations and try to steal **the Spice** from them. The choice is yours.  
There will be three \~30 minute rounds to determine the winning team.  
All participants will receive RT\_AdvancedAmmo as a prize (amount dependent on your team's finishing position) on the main Event Horizon server.   
A few ground rules on allowed ships and equipment: 1, no Unobtanium in your ship designs (hopefully that didn't need clarified); 2, no ships over 500k mass unloaded; and 3, no Repair Firewall cartridges. Repair Hacked Systems and Hack Firewall cartridges are permitted.\*  


See you then.  


\*Due to the current setup of hacking cartridges, having Repair Firewall cartridges makes you essentially immune to hack attempts. On a creative server where you could simply spawn more as needed, allowing them means hacking simply won't be an option for attackers, which obviously screws up my event rules a fair amount.",2019-06-01 02:54:26,4,0,0.8807,1,1,1.0

The devs announced that in response to the continued requests to adding planetary landing to IsR, they would remove the planets entirely in an attempt to get players to shut up about them.

The PvP mode is being phased out in an attempt to appeal to a younger, more impatient audience.

""We're also removing the Geoff droids from the game, as too many players were confused as to why they couldn't walk around and refused to wrap their undeveloped minds around the idea that pathfinding was impossible without requiring large code rewrites, insisting 'minecraft does it!?!?!@!'"".

Bones has been made IsR's new community moderator, with developers citing ""anyone who ticks off that many people must be doing something right"". Bones moved to immediately ban all facts that disagreed with her opinions. ""They'er just bullys, facts aren't rael (sic)""

Conquintor, lighting up a cigar with $100 bills, had an important announcement:""We've sold out to Epic Games in order to fund development of our next project, IsR Battle Royale. Interstellar Rift will continue *cough* ""active"" development, but expect this new project to take up more of our time in the coming months. Some ISR BR features will be able to make it into the original game however. For example, we plan to allow skins purchased in the BR store to be used in the original game, allowing you to look ~~like an idiot~~ your best in both games!""

The original Interstellar Rift will still be available for purchase on Steam though, right?""LOL, no. How else is Epic supposed to beat Steam? By actually improving their store or something? LOL, when pigs fly""

Concerns were raised immediately about players who owned the game on Steam and didn't want to switch to the Epic Store. Hurles, chugging a bottle of champagne, was quick to allay fears:""All players who already own the game on Steam will still be able to play the game as normal. However, to ensure a universal experience for our Epic players, the IsR Steam Workshop is being removed effective immediately. If you used the workshop as a backup for ship designs, you should have known better. Designs are not recoverable.""",2019-05-17 05:58:09,6,0,0.9905,1,1,1.0

Extractors can now be told to stop mining and dump the remaining resources into space. You can also tell the extractor to mine a resource out of a rock out of order, so you can skip straight to the gold or platinum. It doesn't appear to have any ties to automation cards, so this will require manual operation.  
The refinery has a new feature where you can set the target value higher than the total resources in the refinery's buffer. So long as there's some of the raw resource(s) needed in the buffer, the refinery will keep mining until the target value is reached. ""Doesn't this allow you to skip on using automation cards for refineries?"" Sort of. If the you fall behind a bit and the buffer runs out, the refinery will stop and will not attempt to start up again later. An automation card will prompt the refinery to keep busy. The automation card also enables the refinery to handle multiple types of resources.  
Also coming next patch, automation cards for the cargo teleporters!   
[https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu](https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu)  
Fairly straightforward, you can select nearby ships as destinations, even select vaults as a destination. Apparently the card somehow tracks the Steam ID to ensure it goes to the right person's vault. Apparently it even remembers the settings if you go out of range of the other ship, though it sounds like if the ship rifts to another system and rifts back it breaks.   


A ""match speed to target"" function is coming, actually two functions. One matches your ship's speed to the current speed of the target, the other tries to keep your ship's speed in sync with the target, even if the target changes speed. (They attempted to show this off in the steam, it's not *quite* finished yet. It makes the ship's go *a* speed, just not the speed they actually want to go. They're getting there.)

Things were going swimingly on the devstream right up until the \~35 minute mark when they tried to engage some Skrill. This is when they discovered that the workshop ship they were using had never actually been used in combat, as evidenced by the fact that it's ammo loaders weren't assigned to a group. Take note kiddies, never trust a workshop ship without extensive testing.Said ship also claimed the life of poor Sentinel, as they discovered one of the floor fans either had it's own life support group (yes that's a thing) or was not assigned to the life support group. Don't trust workshop ships.

Sentinel was revealed to apparently be a giant, requiring a reinforced chair and is apparently too tall to ride on roller-coasters.

9867,InterstellarRift,"Combat 3.0, or, what would happen if IsR was developed solely by me.

Basically writing this for fun, but hopefully the devs take some ideas from this.^(1)

Goals:

1. Every combat situation has multiple ways it can go down besides one of the ships blows up.
2. Extended combat duration. The max possible DPS should take a minute minimum with constant firing to destroy the max possible EHP.
3. Jack of all Trades, Master of None for combat vessels.
4. Piracy: high risk, high reward.
5. Which weapons you have has more of an impact.

I'm going to try to keep the following from being too much of a wall of text, but a lot of this stuff is closely tied together^(2), so you'll have to bear with me.

&#x200B;

**Section 1\] Ship Health**

At this point I think everyone knows my views on armor gens and the flaws with them, so we'll skip that. Revert ship health to simply hull. Some changes: only walls, floors, and ceiling tiles provide the hull points, alternatively add heavier exterior blocks that provide hull points in addition to standard, lighter exterior blocks. Additionally, cap max hull. Something relatively high, \~1,000,000.

&#x200B;

**Section 2\] CPU**

CPU is a good tool to ensure that gunwalls aren't a thing, but we don't have to tie every system related to combat into it. By doing so you're reducing the likelihood of people using them in the first place since an extra gun is almost always going to be worth more. Limit hacking terminals to just one per ship. Same for the EMP. EMP can have a greater emphasis on being skill based, with a longer cool-down. Ammo loaders don't need to cost CPU at all. You can load them with an ACTR, and as far as I know the devs don't intend to change that. Even now I don't bother with more than a few ammo loaders if space is a concern since a cargo pad and an ACTR have a much better ammo:ship tile ratio.

&#x200B;

**Section 3\]** **Ship Speeds**

The low end of the IsR speed cap is 150 m/s. However, that's 335 MPH. For comparison, a Formula 1 car goes less than 250 MPH. Obviously space is much bigger and some people build ships big enough it takes time to fly from one end to the next. Still, it's a lot faster than it needs to be, you can cross the 2 km weapon range in 5 seconds; and the top speed disparity between 150 m/s and 500 m/s makes for certain aspects of combat balancing complicated.  Reduce max speed^(3) to 150 m/s, and turning is harder the faster your ship is moving, scaling up with the mass of your ship. Turn speed gains a mass cap like we have now for ship speeds.

&#x200B;

**Section 4\] Rock Paper Scissors**

By significantly reducing ship speeds, weapon range can have more of an impact, since you can't simply close the gap in a few seconds. Due to technical limitations of IsR, max possible range of any weapon is 4km, but that still leaves enough wiggle room for significant differences. Some other RPS balance options in IsR are things like RoF, accuracy, countermeasures (torpedoes could have significant range and damage compared to other weapons, but are vulnerable to being shot down or disrupted by an EMP burst), spool-up (railguns), travel time of the projectiles, extended cool-downs on ""super weapons"", and of course damage.

&#x200B;

**Section 5\] Specialization**

RPS balancing is hampered by weapon groups, since any benefits or negatives of choosing one weapon setup over another are non-existent when you can have 10 possible weapon arrangements. Limit ships to one weapon group. There is the option to adjust what weapons are active in a group in game already, so you wouldn't have to return to port to change armaments, but it shouldn't be fast enough to easily do so in combat.

&#x200B;

**Section 6\] Shields**

Shields should remain tied to the CPU system, but CPU cost could be reduced, and shields should have more flexibility. Add a slider to shield gens, one end marked regen rate, one end marked max capacity. Slider should be synced across all shield gens. If you expect to be dealing with high RoF weapons, increase regen rate. Someone's coming after you with a railgun alpha-strike ship, crank up the capacity. Once your shields hit 0, it takes considerably longer for them to come back online. (Devs are already planning that one.)  Ion ammo and ammunition that deals different damage to shields than hull add unneeded complexity IMO.

&#x200B;

**Section 7\] Hacking**

Hacking is an interesting tool for combat balancing, as everyone is ""equal"", assuming you limit everyone to one cyber terminal. Some improvements are needed however. Add a hacking screen in the cockpit so you don't need to dedicate a crew member to hacking to get any use out of it. Some skill aspect could also be added, like a simple [quick time event](https://youtu.be/_YQY-NYiM6c?t=5) that you can operate with just a single key. For the cards, instead of them being used as ammo for hacking, they could instead upgrade the terminal, increasing range, automatically preform the quicktime event when defending, increase max firewall health, reduce connection time, or reducing recovery time. You're limited to 8 slots with just one terminal, so you could potentially get quite creative with RPS balancing here as well.

&#x200B;

**Section 8\] Scanning, Visibility, and Stealth**

This is a mechanic that has always fascinated me because of the possibilities, and I really hope devs come back to the scanner mechanic in particular. Some ideas there: heat mechanic, when fully implemented, plays heavily into how you're detected at long ranges. Also could have active and passive scanners. Go active and you can more easily find and track other ships, but you turn into a light on a hill.

The cloak gen was frankly a massive letdown for me when it was released, as all the restrictions on it render it little more than a poor alternative to the station shield.

In my perfect world, cloak gen no longer has any affect at longer ranges, but it engages the ""deep cloak"" (clear shader) instantly. However, the cloak gen can only maintain a cloak for a limited amount of time, possibly dependent on the mass of the ship. Firing weapons no longer break cloak, but you could track the ship by looking at the weapon projectiles, looking for heat signatures, or large amounts of active scanning. Successfully hitting a cloaked ship would break it's cloak early.

&#x200B;

**Section 9\] Device Damage**

Like hacking, interior damage lends itself to being a balancing tool, but right now it has almost no impact on combat for a few reasons. Combat doesn't last long enough for the power loss from damaged devices to make an impact, many devices don't actually lose any functionality when damaged, and there's also the problem of how device damage is decided in the first place. Right now, interior devices take damage based on how close they are to the point of impact on the exterior. I believe it's a 3 meter sphere around the point of impact that determines what devices are damaged. This system does however mean you can prevent device damage entirely by surrounding your ship with exterior blocks more than 3m away from the actual interior of your ship.

I'm not sure what technical limitations are in place, but I'm going to presume that any system that can track the angle that a projectile hit at and create a straight line along which devices are damaged isn't possible. If it is possible, then please implement that. If it's not possible however, decide what devices are damaged are picked through RNG. For example, railguns deal high damage to only a few devices, while flak guns damage nearly every device onboard the ship but only a few points of damage each. Exterior devices could still be damaged based on proximity to impact.

&#x200B;

**Section 10\] Armor**

Since at this point almost all ship designs are going to have armor gens, and people have vaults full of nanobots, removing armor altogether is not really an option; and of course that would also be a fair amount of wasted modeling work. Some ideas for replacement uses for them:

* Armor gens provide additional hull points based on a percentage value of the ships default hull value. Shouldn't be extreme, dedicating 100% of your CPU to armor would get you max 50% bonus hull.
* Armor remains a separate value, and the amount of armor you have determines how much device damage you take. Certain weapon and ammunition types would deal armor damage in addition to standard damage, or possibly ignore armor altogether when dealing interior damage.

**Section 11\] Ship Repair and Support Devices**

Ship repair in IsR is something that doesn't really have too much impact because you can just salvage the ship, and there's also a significant amount of disparity between the various existing options for ship repair. Add some incentive to keep players from always salvaging their ship, and

This is an area that doesn't really have any existing systems in IsR, but I hope to see them eventually. This would be an area capital ships could excel at.  These would be ""weapons"" which cost CPU, but could beam extra power and shields to other ships, and repair hull and interior devices.

**Section 12\] Warping**

Remove warp disruption on hit. It's an overly complicated mechanic that the victim doesn't have any out of unless his ship is incredibly maneuverable. For T0 and T1 NPC enemies players are still going to be ""poor"" enough that forcing them to fight runs the high risk of costing them their ship which will most likely be all they have at that moment.

**Section 13\] Rifting**

Just a couple possibles solutions the issue of using rifting as an easy out to combat. First is, let us blow up rifts. If you shoot a rift, the damage (x2 or x3 since damage values are a little small compared to mass values) is subtracted from the mass of the rift. If that's not possible, apply the old warp disruption on hit mechanic to rifting, though maybe only when shields are down.",2019-02-22 01:15:08,2,0,-0.9972,-1,-1,1.0

This FAQ has been approved by Hurles and contains updated information.

**Q: What is Interstellar Rift**

A: Interstellar Rift is a space simulation game where you can gather resources, construct your own ship from the inside out, help build space stations with a crew of friends or play solo to further your goals, in a procedurally generated galaxy.

Here is the Beta trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs)

**Q: On what platform(s) will Interstellar Rift be available?**

A: Interstellar Rift is currently available on Steam, for Windows PC.

**Q: When will Interstellar Rift be released?**

A: Interstellar Rift went into Steam Early Access, then entered Beta on October 11, 2018, and is slated for a full release sometime later.

**Q: Will I be able to play in single player?**

A: Yes, however the game is focusing on multiplayer; the single player game content is the same as multiplayer, but your game will not appear in the server list, so it will not have other players joining. You can build stations and do missions for various factions to build reputation, all while defending from occasional alien incursions. We have plans for narrative driven missions however we will reveal more about those once we are closer to implementing them.

**Q: Is Interstellar Rift an MMO?**

A: Interstellar Rift is not an MMO, but there is persistence for as long as a server is active and the save not reset. Players are currently playing on servers which have been persistent for two years! Servers will be privately hosted by players and we aim to support up to 64 players at a time, at launch. This number may increase later down the line.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**

A: Minimum and Recommended specs are as follows:

MINIMUM:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: Intel Dual Core 2GHz
* Memory: 4 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 440 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 2 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

RECOMMENDED:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: AMD or Intel Quad Core
* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 5 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

You maybe be able to play the game on a system that does not meet the minimum requirements however we cannot guarantee that.

**Q: Can I walk around inside my own ship?**

A: Yes, you and your crew can get up and walk around the interior of your own custom starship while underway, at any speed.

**Q: What can I do inside my starship?**

A: Ship interior gameplay is an integral part of Interstellar Rift. You can take control of different ship systems, gather different types of resources, repair broken systems, use gun turrets, operate missile launchers, build and dispatch drones, defend your ship from aliens and hostile boarders, trade with other players who you can teleport aboard, or just socialize with your crew.

**Q: How many ships can I have? Can I change them?**

A: You can have as many ships as you wish to build! You can modify your current ship anytime, as long as you have the materials and you can get everyone off the ship, onto a station with a modification terminal, so the upgrade work can be done to the ship.

**Q: Can I attack other players and board their ship?**

A: Yes, once you have disabled and hacked another player‚Äôs ship, you can teleport aboard and raid it, you can even steal their ship if you manage to disable their ability to respawn, but the same can happen to you!

**Q: Is this game a first person shooter?**

A: The entire game is in first person. Boarding another player‚Äôs ship without permission can result in hostility which you can indeed resolve with the use of FPS gameplay mechanics. Aliens may penetrate and infect ship systems, which you will have to locate and destroy. But the game is not focused around first person shooter gameplay. Shooting another player is a choice not a requirement.

**Q: How will I gather resources?**

A: Ships can be equipped with sensors, resource extractors, gas cloud harvesters and refinery equipment. These can gather resources, mine asteroids and produce construction materials. There is a massive strip mining system for producing very large quantities of building materials, and ram scoops for gathering or mixing gases for rare materials as well. You can also build large drone bays and drones, to dispatch and gather resources or defend you. Defeating aliens provides an opportunity to use a salvaging system to recover unique materials and some common types as well. You can also raid cargo from other players, space stations or trade for different resources.

**Q: Will I be able to build space stations?**

A: Yes, if you have gathered enough materials to construct a station, you can build it on site, or with a cockpit and engines to fly to your launch location. You can provide power from solar panels and fix the position with a gravity anchor. The process is nearly identical to ship construction. You can use the ship editor terminal to customize it similar to how you construct a ship. You can add weapons to it and there is even an invulnerable station shield, but you will need special crystals to fuel it.

**Q: What stops me from creating a kilometer long ship completely covered in guns that will own everything that gets near it?**

A: Practicality. Every ship in Interstellar Rift requires power and oxygen, and CPU to operate the shields and weapons. The bigger your ship, the higher the requirements. Projectile weapons, missiles and lasers require ammunition and energy shields drain considerable power from the system. Opening a rift to travel to another star in such a ship would be incredibly expensive in resources. Nothing prevents you from creating a giant ship like that, but whether or not you can maintain and defend it is the question.

**Q: My ship was destroyed/stolen. What now?**

A: If your ship has an escape pod, you can fly away and salvage the pod for some materials to start. You can purchase or build another ship. If you have the resources in your vault, you can build another ship from your stored blueprints at the ship editor terminal. Each of the starter stations also has the equipment to allow you to quickly gather resources. You can save the resources to build a ship yourself or sell them to purchase another ship already constructed at the Store-o-Tron. Many faction stations also have a terminal which will allow you to take out a loan to get you flying sooner.

**Q: I have built this gorgeous ship, can I use it on other servers?**

A: Yes and No, you cannot use a ship on any other server but the one you built it on. However the blueprint for that ship is stored locally and will be available for you on every server you join. All you need to do is gather the materials again to build it. You can also share the blueprint files with others.

**Q: How will space travel work?**

A: There are 3 modes of space travel in Interstellar Rift:

* Sublight travel: This is your normal cruising speed. In      this travel mode you will fight, mine and basically do everything. In this      mode you will have direct control over you ship and where it flies.
* Warp Travel: Warp is your main mode of transport within      a star system. It propels you faster than light and allows you to quickly      travel around a star system. In this mode you will have minimal control      over your ship.
* Hyperspace Jump: The hyperspace jump allows you to      travel between different star systems instantly through a rift created by      a rift generator. This is a point to point means of travel where the ship      is slowly flown through the created rift to a different star system. You      can still walk around inside the ship while the jump through a rift is      occurring.

**Q: Can I make videos using your game(s) and monetize them?**

A: Yes, we encourage people to make video‚Äôs using Split Polygon game content. However the video must be free to access by everyone. You cannot charge people to watch a video containing Split Polygon copyrighted materials. We also do not allow you to license these videos out to other parties for payment of any kind.

Maybe keep a public scoreboard of the richest dudes on the server and make competitions or events or whatever.

9894,InterstellarRift,"Idea: Battery station & Battery pack

Hello,

First off all, i'm pretty new to IR.
I think it would be a cool idea if you could build a ""battery station"". This station would be able tk create ""battery packs"". You can take the battery packs in your inventory, store them on cargo pads or place them in another battery station.
This would mean when creating a battery pack, you will take stored power from that power group or give the extra power to a powergroup.
To be able to add power to a battery station you need available space in batteries or powercells.

9897,InterstellarRift,"Ship Building thoughts

Hello, I am a relative noob. I have had Interstellar Rift for a little over half a year and have played around with it here and there, but recently I have been getting more into it. One of the things that keeps drawing me in is Ship Building. So I wanted to spark a discussion about Ship Building. A few questions I want to reach out and ask:

1. What speed range do you generally try to keep your ships in? I personally like to make sure my builds can stay between 140 ~ 300 m/s depending on the style of ship I'm building. I personally never like my ships being rated slower than 140 m/s.

2. Do you draft out your designs before you build them, or do you prefer to go with the flow? I tend to draft my designs deck by deck in a graphing paper notebook before I build them. This has helped me better understand the editor as well.

3. What primary sources of power do you use for most of your ships? I struggled with this for a while and recently started strapping the huge Hydrogen Generators on my ships because the small generators and the solar panels don't seem to produce enough power to be worth it.

4. How to external design? All my ships look like blobs, unintentionally of course, but I wanted to know if you guys follow any design philosophies? Do your ships have a common design theme or concept when looked at from the outside?

5. This is more of a question of technical efficiency rather than preference, but is it worth putting the huge engines that you can place from systems? I only built 1 ship using these engines and they didn't seem to be that good. I much prefer the engines you can place from exterior mode.",2018-02-15 21:41:19,4,0,0.9854,1,1,1.0

9923,InterstellarRift,"Steam Sale Noob - My Take on IR

Myself and my hubby purchased Interstellar Rift the other day from the Steam sale. Here's my take on the game so far. *Take my comments with a pinch, I'm well versed playing EA/Alpha games, but also I'm only 25 ish hours in.*

Wow, first of all. Wow! The look of the game is fantastic. Really truly, what a good looking game. 
One of my utter favourite things is how your character interacts with systems and consoles. Really putting the immersion there. I play games mainly on RP servers with a solid group of RP players, some of whom have also purchased IR in the Steam Sale. I see a great opportunity for RP play within this game, if only my character could punch!  
I play as an engineer. My Hubby pilots the boat, (my driving usually gets us killed so I'll leave that to him and I'll take care of the ship).  
I have found Interstellar Rift to be quite persistent with drawing me in to play it. The Ship Editor is fantastic, [I built a small ship](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=958327993) (Tel'Tek Stargate style I plan to upload on the workshop after testing in game), had a really lovely evening designing and tweaking that ship, but then all of a sudden I realised I had missed dinner, forgotten about the real world and it's 4am and I have to go to work in 3 hours....  
There are missions to play through, I can't mention much on this as I have not touched that in game yet, but again it's a lovely addition, bringing content into play.

I was surprised by the lack of player base out there, I do hope the Steam Summer sale helps this game get some attention.

**What's difficult with the game:**  
As it's in development I'm not going to say much here, having a good time playing an unfinished/Alpha/EA game is simply something people strongly differ on, it's like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Or in the way of EA games, you either deal with the bugs/issues or you don't. All I can say is if you see/experience a bug or issue, report it. Split Polygon have a forum for bug reports, and also the Dev's seem to be very responsive to bug reports, at least acknowledging them even if they cannot address them instantly.

This game is not particularly (in it's current state) beginner friendly. Server setup is a bit finicky. Navigation is tricky and there's a lot to learn about the game, especially all the systems and resources, but this is something time will cure, a steep learning curve is something I prefer, but the introductions given are adequate enough to get you started and not spoil it all in the process.

**Looking forward to:**  
Navigational improvements.  
Being able to punch someone (something I missed straight away, not being able to punch my friends or Hubby for no good reason).  
Being able to take my character's helmet off... Would bring in more immersion and also would provide the danger for possible issues if something went wrong with the ship.
 
**Would I recommend this game?**
To a person who was OK with playing an EA/Alpha game, yes. To those who are not, just wait and follow this game's progress, keep an eye on it, I'm sure it's going to go far (*crosses-fingers for luck*).

9932,InterstellarRift,"Plugin To Clean Up Ships Around Starter Stations

Hey everyone,

So Chip asked me to make a plugin for his Reaper server that cleaned up all ships within 1000 meters of the starter stations.

I figured others may take interest in this plugin as well. I know that a lot of servers, (such as OurMind), have a policy to just destroy ships that are left unattended and offline around spawn. Hopefully this will make things easier for both the user and the admin :D

What it does is every 8 hours (configurable), it checks each ship within 3,000 meters (configurable) of each starter station to see if that ship is a.) unoccupied and b.) if the owner is offline. If both are true, it stores the ship in that starter station's vault.

The plugin works but it still needs quite a lot of testing so I would recommend holding off on using it until Chip and I can test it out a little bit more :) but it seems to work from initial testing.

You can check it out plus the source code on the Augtrix website:

http://git.augtrix.com/KingFredrickVI/ShipCleanup

Starting off, I've been loving all the activity these past few weeks! It's great to see people posting questions, and chatting about future updates here.

I've been thinking of more ways for us to drum up some more activity to help grow the community for both /r/InterstellarRift and the game as a whole, and one thing that I keep coming back to is having the subreddit host a monthly ship building challenge.

The idea would be for each month to have a specific theme, or limitation. One month, the challenge may be to build a ship that is entirely solar powered, the next to build a cheap mining station that can be deployed and anchored at a belt, or a ship that can travel over a 500 m/s but costs less than a certain amount of materials.

The competition would run from the 1st of each month, through the 21st, with either the ship that meets the requirements the best, or an online poll deciding the winner, who would be announced at the end of the month. As far as a prize goes, at the very least I could give the winner a custom flair saying they won the challenge for a certain month, as well as cataloguing all the winners on the subreddits wiki.

So I'd like to gauge how much interest there would be in something like this, as well as see if you guys have ideas as to some creative potential challenges?",2017-01-09 16:56:42,5,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

9943,InterstellarRift,"Life beyond Hadron; where to go when your ready to explore

As we host a server, there have been a few people asking me, what do I do now that I have a decent ship? The short answer, Head for the stars!

But digging in, where should you go and how to go about it? A huge part of the game is exploring the many solar systems in the galaxy - there are so many! I've been to around 30 systems give/take, and I haven't scratched the surface of the galaxy yet!

You're going to need a Rift Generator, so if your ship doesn't have one, no problem, head to any station that has Rift Hub, Trans Sphere, or the like in the station's name. These stations have Rift Generators in them that anyone can use.

Using a holotable or the holomap in the rift generator, you can select a system, and see what factions, stations and minerals can be found there. Choosing a system with a higher chance of beryllium and nitrogen is a good first choice, so you can refine and stock up on Xanthium, which is part of the fuel the rift generator will need to operate. If your ship doesn't have a rift generator on board, you probably want a system with a rift hub type station as well, at least if you plan to return to Hadron without building a Rift Generator.

You can always sell common minerals and goods at trade stations to buy up smaller quantities of rare minerals you need to get your exploration ship built and fuel to open a rift. Sound like fun?

Give it a try!

Edit: Your're! That's what I get for trying to type on an iPad.

I love it, but it seems to me that there is a lack of further development. Did the company just drop this game? is it still getting content updates? I see so much potential yet a lack of new content and even more important, a lack of community and players. 

I would love to see this game blow up, I would love to wage into massive battles, or scavenge ships while trying to be careful not to run into hostile players, even better get stranded with out power and be rescued by friends.

Public Service Announcement:

So after spending a lot of time, resources, money and close calls I lost my prize ship today. It was 125 blocks in length, 45 blocks in width 2 x drone bays, 2 x Large Shields, 1 x Station Shield, cloak over 600,000 k hydrogen tank capacity for extended trips, ship storage system, armed to the teeth, 4 x refineries, 4 x extractors complete multipurpose ship. Well over 5.5 mil to insure (didn't insure it  couldn't afford to)

&#x200B;

So why is this a public service announcement? Well after surviving an onslaught of Skrill with torpedo's and missiles in a T3 system I rifted into a relatively safe T2 system to do some mining and collect resources, refuel etc. Parked at the mining station, activated station shields, deployed drones, started extracting water to make fuel for my 4 x Extra Large Hydrogen tanks.

&#x200B;

10 x Skrill attack, my weapons are dropping their numbers but my station shield is not online (10 min to go), so I turn off the shield and start running, manage to destroy them all then get back to my parking spot. Engage station shield and start doing repairs etc. After 9 minutes I hear guns, thinking oh more skrill, next my shields are going down I jump to the cockpit no skrill??? WTF??? see a swarm of protection drones all red around me shooting me. Did I leave my guns on? Did I accidently shoot the station? No to both my guns were off I was 800 m from station so why are these drones attacking me??!!???! I attempt to run, call for repair drones to repair the ship but more drones arrive only to attack me and worse they took my credits so WTF I paid to be attacked? No it wasn't a reputation issue I was at 3500 rep for my faction and around 1500 for all the other factions. So after freaking out I ran around the ship and noticed the Skrill had infected my ship with their internal creatures. After removing them the drones continued to attack me, apparently awaiting the cooldown timer, so once again I request repairs from the service....cost me 4.5 million for the service call. Guess what more drones appeared and started attacking me needless to say I died, my ship was destroyed and now am broke sitting in the station going WTF just happened.

So long story short what I have learned and am guessing the issue was if your ship is infected by the Skrill, the AI considers you as an enemy and will attack you so anytime you are attacked and your shields go down, do yourself a favor stay away from stations until you have done a complete check of your ship for the internal parasites otherwise you will end up in the same situation I was in getting attacked and not knowing why.

&#x200B;

Will I recover? Absolutely I have another great ship in another system in storage and I have always dumped my high value resources into my vault or my freighter then store my ship in the station for protection.

&#x200B;

Long slow process to get to where I was but just the nature of the game, you can't always win and sometimes it takes a good asskicking to get your head straight. That is my Public Service Announcement.",2021-02-24 19:02:24,7,0,-0.9979,-1,-1,1.0

Hey ya all. Quick question with long explanation.

We all know that later in game making specialised ships isn't really useful. We got materials, we got money, we got all we need in quantities wchich exceed usage. So, this question will be divided into two questions.

1. At early game, do you think it's better to specialize ships to avoid some costs, like fuel and materials?
2. Later in game, do you specialize your ships? For example, for convienience (so you don't have to run miles around ship), cost (fuel, coolant etc.) or to avoid potential cost of loosing said ship? (PvP)

I am just curious. And I tend to specialize my ships in both cases, because I like building them so yeah. But what about you all?",2020-11-23 15:53:38,6,0,0.61,1,1,1.0

10018,InterstellarRift,"Changes to the Event Horizon IsR server

IsR 1.0 is launching on September 24th. In an attempt to capitalize on the increased player traffic that the launch will (hopefully) bring, there are going to be considerable changes to how Event Horizon ([http://event-horizon.site](http://event-horizon.site), [https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) operates. This includes a full wipe of the main EH server, though players won't necessarily be starting over with zero resources (more details on that below).

The goals of these changes are to encourage longer term player retention, encourage more regular player interactions (both PvE and PvP interactions), and to give long term goals/achievements for players and organizations. 

These changes will include (but are not necessarily limited to):

‚Ä¢Fewer star systems in the EH galaxy (currently looking at about 4-6 ""useful"" systems in total).

‚Ä¢A new central star system (Hadron) that all players will start in.

‚Ä¢Limited resource spawns in the asteroid belts (both of type and quantity).

‚Ä¢Seasons of PvP and PvE (though there will be one permanent PvE star system, and one permanent PvP star system).

‚Ä¢Addition of randomly spawning, short lived, asteroid fields; same as the ones that spawn at NPC mining stations. Note that these fields will have more than just T0 resources. These will spawn in random locations, encouraging players to seek them out and compete with other groups to mine them.

‚Ä¢Return of server events, such as PvP tournaments, but also PvE events.

‚Ä¢A new unique currency (Eventium) on the server, represented by a custom resource. Players can earn this currency in various ways, including trading with/stealing from other players. Players will be able to trade Eventium in for other resources, but they will also be able to use it to purchase custom stations, purchase special services, or use it to purchase resources after the wipes. Automated scripts will be in place to help with many of these Eventium transactions, which will hopefully allow it to be considerably more useful. 

Not all of these changes will be present on Event Horizon as soon as 1.0 launches, and are subject to change based on what 1.0 adds and how many players EH can attract with the 1.0 launch. The current EH server will continue as is until the 24th, and will probably still be left online, at least temporarily, after the 1.0 launch. The new server will simply take its place on the 24th.

(Potentially) Frequently Asked Questions:

*Why are you wiping the server? I don't want to start over again!*

The server wipe does two things: the first (and primary) reason is that it allows me to create a new IsR server and work on setting it up over the next few weeks, without needing to worry about preserving/transferring/losing player progress. The second reason is that it's encouraging for new players to know that everyone else on the server don't have a massive advantage over them; and for many existing players it's more engaging to have a fresh start. 

That said, I know starting completely over in IsR can be a bit of a grind, so starter packs will be given out to existing players, based on how long they've been on the Discord. If you left the Discord and then came back later on, I'll still count it. The exact amount and type of resources in the starter packs has yet to be decided, but it will be based on the tier system. 2+ years equals T3, 1+ year equals T2, 6+ months equals T1, and anyone arriving before the launch of 1.0 will get some T0 resources. More details on that can be found on the EH Discord ([https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) leading up to the 1.0 launch.

*Why are you having so few star systems, other servers have hundreds!*

The huge number of star systems that IsR spawns by default is actually a problem with IsR, even if you assume a server regularly has 64 players (something that has never happened). Star systems in IsR are already so enormous that you could put the full 64 players in a single star system, remove signatures and transponders, and it would be practically impossible to find another player. Even in Vectron Syx on popular servers the only time you'll run into another player is when they're back at HSC IC to rearm/store their ship. The rest of the time players are scattered across the stars. On a server with even 50 star systems PvP is practically impossible, and even just trying to meet up with other players to trade with/crew with them is a chore.   
Having infinite star systems also equals infinite resources, which completely removes any reason to interact with other players for resources. Why trade with/fight with other players for resources when you can just as easily (or even easier) mine them yourself by finding a system with a high rating of your target resource?

*What special services?*  
Good question. I haven't thought of very many at the moment, it would be things like allowing players to rename planets/stars, and to have the Skrill/faction rating of a system adjusted. I'm sure players will give me other ideas as we go forwards.  
*PvP/PvE seasons?*  
This is an idea I acquired from other Empyrion servers during that brief period where I hosted an Emp server for EH (apologies to those players who wanted such a server for longer, it proved to be more effort than I was willing to give, especially as Empyrion was a game I didn't find very engaging).  
The star systems on Event Horizon will cycle between majority PvE and majority PvP toggle on a regular cycle. If you're not interested in engaging in PvP, you can still play on Event Horizon, but PvP players will get bonus Eventium and other rewards for beating other groups. There will also be changes to encourage raids of other org's stations during PvP seasons.

  
*""After the wipes""? What wipes?*

This is the one change I'm not fully decided on. I'm considering having the server wipe every so often, with a handful of things carrying over, like Eventium. I'm not fully convinced that the benefits of this outweigh the downsides, but at minimum these wipes would only take place every 6 months at the minimum; most likely even rarer.

Event Horizon is having a design contest to pick a ""replacement"" design for The Black Pit.

Contest will end in about six weeks, but may be longer depending on how long it takes me to get my act together with the new server.Who: anyone who can build a station that isn't an eyesore.Reward: I'll get back to you on that. (There will be a reward of some sort, but I haven't had the time to put thought into what exactly.)Special Instructions: In order to ensure that nothing is broken, your new station must be built alongside the Black Pit. What this means is you need to load the Black Ship file, move over 20 squares, and start your design there. Players can use teleporters to cross from the original Black Pit to the new station.Design Requirements: the station needs to be easily navigated, no endless hallways. Need two large mining bays, similar to those on the HSC IC. No ACTRs, however make sure the new station has all the standard NPC terminals, as well as mission boards and drop boxes. 3D printers and assemblers are up to you as to whether or not you want to include them. Having an ""admin"" room with a transponder and a shield generator would be appreciated, but not necessarily required.You can use the following file to start with. MAKE SURE YOU START WITH THE FOLLOWING DESIGN AND MAKE NO CHANGES TO ITS INTERNALS. If you'd like to make changes to the exterior of the original Black Pit, i.e. ""attaching"" the two designs together with exterior blocks, that is acceptable.

I haven't gotten into too much combat in the game, and noticed that certain weapons need crew (like turrets and reloading torpedos/missles) If the multicrew combat is pretty fun then I might be able to sell my friends on the game, but if that's not quite developed yet, then I think I'll need to let IR bake a bit longer before I can get my friends on board.",2019-07-17 19:03:02,7,0,0.9631,1,1,1.0

## Heist Aboard the Trafalgar

Echelon Company reports that one of their ships was found to have been boarded, looted and damaged late on the 9th of June. Could this be the result of independent hackers, or was it an inside job? Interstellar Newsline is here reporting on the investigation.

The Trafalgar is Echelon Company‚Äôs only active warship and was in the process of conducting long term nuclear reactor trials in an attempt to breed superior nuclear fuels, according to one EC representative. The stolen goods amount to over 30 U-238, 15 Pu-239, 1 Pu-241, 100 standard torpedos, 50 rounds of railgun bolts and 10 T3 heat sinks. Estimates of the value of goods lost put the cost between 100 and 125 Million units and damages in excess of 800,000 units.

Echelon Company stated that the Trafalgar has been put back into service as a combat vessel for escort and stealth operations. Prior to the incident the fuel was intended to fuel EC‚Äôs interests over the next few weeks as they industrialize and improve their ship building capabilities. Echelon Company declined to comment on suspects of the heist, but had the following to say: ‚ÄúI implore independent pilots and faction aligned pilots alike to develop \[their\] own security protocols for \[their ships\] if \[they\] are unable to store them in a station.‚Äù

## Traffic Collision Results in Destroyed Ship at HSC Industrial Complex

Monday, June 10th

Echelon Company lost a ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù class industrial ship today following a traffic collision at the HSC Industrial Complex in Vectron Syx.

The Commodore was parked at the HSC Industrial Complex and was collided into by a Quartermaster class industrial ship piloted by Turkey Sandvich, CEO of the Long-Limb Roe Acquisition Specialists faction. Station police records show that Mr. Sandvich has been involved in numerous collision incidents at the station in the past, but never any that resulted in the destruction of a ship. A police representative stated that the station telemetry recorded that the damage which was done only amounted to 6HP. This indicates that the destroyed ship was already in a very weakened state or had its defensive systems offline prior to the collision.

Mr. Sandvich stated that ‚Äúderelicts should not be parked in a congested area like that around the HSC station. It could pose a danger to any parking ships if they were to explode like this one.‚Äù The two involved parties have settled the matter privately.

## Materials Lost Aboard the AprilDan and her Sister Ship

Another two Echelon Company ships this week were looted while mining cloaked in deep space.

Materials lost aboard both ships amount to at least 7.5 Million Units in T3 materials and ammo. Nuclear rods and hydrogen had to be replaced and damage was sustained due to a skrill attack following the theft according to the Echelon Company Public Information Office. When asked about potential suspects, a statement made by the office stated: ‚ÄúWe have no clue who could have found us to do this.  We have locked all company vaults to only company officers.‚Äù

The ECPIO further stated that both ships have been put back into service to replace the lost fuel rods and materials and said ‚ÄúBoth ships are in space dock hopefully engineers and IT specialists can help identify the guilty party.  Justice will be swift in league with the old ‚ÄòShock and Awe‚Äô type of retribution.‚Äù

S3 investigators looking into the theft commented that the ship‚Äôs logs show that one of the ship‚Äôs cloaking devices was disrupted by the launch of a mining drone. This could have allowed a hacker to find the ship and gain access to steal the materials. They went on to state, however, that they are not ruling out the possibility of an inside-job at this time.

In the wake of multiple ship robberies and thefts this week, Interstellar News would like to remind pilots that proper storage of ships is a key to security. Hackers and traitors are all around us and the possibility for theft is always present. If you can‚Äôt afford to lose it, don‚Äôt leave it sitting around!",2019-06-15 19:54:30,7,0,-0.9867,-1,-1,1.0
10032,InterstellarRift,"Interstellar Rift Player Designed Ships Contest 003 - The Lone Wanderers

**It‚Äôs been a while since the last ship design contest, but we‚Äôre happy  to announce a new one. The contest will coincide with the next patch  (0.2.9) which will introduce derelict ships. We will be designing the  bulk of these, but to help us fill out the variety of vessels to  encounter, we need your help! This time we‚Äôll be electing multiple  winners, with 5 ships going into the game this time.**  


As the  previous contests only had a single winner, if you want a ship you  designed to be in the game, this is going to be one of the best chances  you‚Äôll get.   


The ships we‚Äôd like to see are smaller vessels, with  some cargo capacity, and an interesting interior layout, made up of  multiple corridors and rooms so players can explore them.   


Ship description:  
The  ships should be smaller rather than large, as we‚Äôd like these ships to  be explorable in a fairly short amount of time. The ship‚Äôs systems  should function normally, once you encounter one of these ships in the  game, we will dynamically damage some of the devices and place loot on  board. These ships can be made to fit with a certain faction, but we  have no style guide, and you are free to design the exterior to your  liking. You are allowed to use devices from all tiers, as the ships will  spawn in systems relative to the resources used in construction.  


Creating  interesting ways to navigate the ship to get to the loot areas, or  setting up puzzle like power systems to gain access is encouraged.   


Requirements:  
Ship requirements:

* At least 3 rooms.
* At least 2 cargo pads (or a minimum of 16 cargo slots)
* At least 1 locker (or a minimum of 8 tool slots)
* The ship should function normally, no permissions have to be set on devices.
* At least 1 teleporter
* Ship mass can not be more than 100K.  
Things not to do:  
No admin models.  
No holes or traps that can get players stuck.

Contest Rules:  
As with every contest there are rules and regulations that everyone must adhere to so here are ours.

* All submissions must be original, ships resembling established designs outside of Interstellar Rift will be disqualified
* The  contest will run until the 18th of June, any submission made after the  end date will be disqualified. We will be looking at the ships on the  Developer Stream on the 19th of June. 
* All Submissions may  NOT contain and of the following, graphic or sexually oriented imagery.  any depictions of or related to drug use, political views outside of  those present inside of Interstellar Rift. 
* Split Polygon reserves the right to alter any winning submission before implementing it into the game. 
* The contest is open to anyone.

On Saturday, June 8th at 14:00 EST (+4 UTC) I'll be hosting a PvP event on the Event Horizon Interim server (thanks to CrazyDeviant for hosting). If you'd like to participate, please join the EH Discord ([https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW](https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW)) and see #announcements. If you have other questions about the event, you can also ask them there.  
**You do not have to be an existing Event Horizon player to participate.** This event will be taking place on a creative server, and you will be allowed to spawn in your ship designs and whatever ammo and resource you need to power it before the event starts. *The server will have creative mode turned* ***off*** *as soon as the event begins. Make sure your ship and whatever resources you need have already been spawned by then. You'll likely find* /giveallres *an useful command for this. The server is online right now and will stay so through the event, so you should have plenty of time to prepare.*  
If you don't have any PvP ship designs or don't think you'd make a good pilot, you can still easily participate as a boarding party member.  
I will also be running logging tools during the event to help the developers optimize combat on IsR servers. The more players who participate, the more data SplitPolygon can glean from the event.   
**Event Details**  
Participants will be divided among three teams, each with their own nearly invulnerable (but hack-able and board-able) station. A neutral central station will be producing **the Spice** at regular intervals. You'll need to hack the station, gather as much **Spice** as you can carry, and bring it back to your team's station. Alternatively you can attack the other teams' ships and stations and try to steal **the Spice** from them. The choice is yours.  
There will be three \~30 minute rounds to determine the winning team.  
All participants will receive RT\_AdvancedAmmo as a prize (amount dependent on your team's finishing position) on the main Event Horizon server.   
A few ground rules on allowed ships and equipment: 1, no Unobtanium in your ship designs (hopefully that didn't need clarified); 2, no ships over 500k mass unloaded; and 3, no Repair Firewall cartridges. Repair Hacked Systems and Hack Firewall cartridges are permitted.\*  


See you then.  


\*Due to the current setup of hacking cartridges, having Repair Firewall cartridges makes you essentially immune to hack attempts.

The devs announced that in response to the continued requests to adding planetary landing to IsR, they would remove the planets entirely in an attempt to get players to shut up about them.

The PvP mode is being phased out in an attempt to appeal to a younger, more impatient audience.

""We're also removing the Geoff droids from the game, as too many players were confused as to why they couldn't walk around and refused to wrap their undeveloped minds around the idea that pathfinding was impossible without requiring large code rewrites, insisting 'minecraft does it!?!?!@!'"".

Bones has been made IsR's new community moderator, with developers citing ""anyone who ticks off that many people must be doing something right"". Bones moved to immediately ban all facts that disagreed with her opinions. ""They'er just bullys, facts aren't rael (sic)""

Conquintor, lighting up a cigar with $100 bills, had an important announcement:""We've sold out to Epic Games in order to fund development of our next project, IsR Battle Royale. Interstellar Rift will continue *cough* ""active"" development, but expect this new project to take up more of our time in the coming months. Some ISR BR features will be able to make it into the original game however. For example, we plan to allow skins purchased in the BR store to be used in the original game, allowing you to look ~~like an idiot~~ your best in both games!""

The original Interstellar Rift will still be available for purchase on Steam though, right?""LOL, no. How else is Epic supposed to beat Steam? By actually improving their store or something? LOL, when pigs fly""

Concerns were raised immediately about players who owned the game on Steam and didn't want to switch to the Epic Store. Hurles, chugging a bottle of champagne, was quick to allay fears:""All players who already own the game on Steam will still be able to play the game as normal. However, to ensure a universal experience for our Epic players, the IsR Steam Workshop is being removed effective immediately.

Extractors can now be told to stop mining and dump the remaining resources into space. You can also tell the extractor to mine a resource out of a rock out of order, so you can skip straight to the gold or platinum. It doesn't appear to have any ties to automation cards, so this will require manual operation.  
The refinery has a new feature where you can set the target value higher than the total resources in the refinery's buffer. So long as there's some of the raw resource(s) needed in the buffer, the refinery will keep mining until the target value is reached. ""Doesn't this allow you to skip on using automation cards for refineries?"" Sort of. If the you fall behind a bit and the buffer runs out, the refinery will stop and will not attempt to start up again later. An automation card will prompt the refinery to keep busy. The automation card also enables the refinery to handle multiple types of resources.  
Also coming next patch, automation cards for the cargo teleporters!   
[https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu](https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu)  
Fairly straightforward, you can select nearby ships as destinations, even select vaults as a destination. Apparently the card somehow tracks the Steam ID to ensure it goes to the right person's vault. Apparently it even remembers the settings if you go out of range of the other ship, though it sounds like if the ship rifts to another system and rifts back it breaks.   


A ""match speed to target"" function is coming, actually two functions. One matches your ship's speed to the current speed of the target, the other tries to keep your ship's speed in sync with the target, even if the target changes speed. (They attempted to show this off in the steam, it's not *quite* finished yet. It makes the ship's go *a* speed, just not the speed they actually want to go. They're getting there.)

Sentinel was revealed to apparently be a giant, requiring a reinforced chair and is apparently too tall to ride on roller-coasters.

10047,InterstellarRift,"Combat 3.0, or, what would happen if IsR was developed solely by me.

Basically writing this for fun, but hopefully the devs take some ideas from this.^(1)

Goals:

1. Every combat situation has multiple ways it can go down besides one of the ships blows up.
2. Extended combat duration. The max possible DPS should take a minute minimum with constant firing to destroy the max possible EHP.
3. Jack of all Trades, Master of None for combat vessels.
4. Piracy: high risk, high reward.
5. Which weapons you have has more of an impact.

I'm going to try to keep the following from being too much of a wall of text, but a lot of this stuff is closely tied together^(2), so you'll have to bear with me.

&#x200B;

**Section 1\] Ship Health**

At this point I think everyone knows my views on armor gens and the flaws with them, so we'll skip that. Revert ship health to simply hull. Some changes: only walls, floors, and ceiling tiles provide the hull points, alternatively add heavier exterior blocks that provide hull points in addition to standard, lighter exterior blocks. Additionally, cap max hull. Something relatively high, \~1,000,000.

&#x200B;

**Section 2\] CPU**

CPU is a good tool to ensure that gunwalls aren't a thing, but we don't have to tie every system related to combat into it. By doing so you're reducing the likelihood of people using them in the first place since an extra gun is almost always going to be worth more. Limit hacking terminals to just one per ship. Same for the EMP. EMP can have a greater emphasis on being skill based, with a longer cool-down. Ammo loaders don't need to cost CPU at all. You can load them with an ACTR, and as far as I know the devs don't intend to change that. Even now I don't bother with more than a few ammo loaders if space is a concern since a cargo pad and an ACTR have a much better ammo:ship tile ratio.

&#x200B;

**Section 3\]** **Ship Speeds**

The low end of the IsR speed cap is 150 m/s. However, that's 335 MPH. For comparison, a Formula 1 car goes less than 250 MPH. Obviously space is much bigger and some people build ships big enough it takes time to fly from one end to the next. Still, it's a lot faster than it needs to be, you can cross the 2 km weapon range in 5 seconds; and the top speed disparity between 150 m/s and 500 m/s makes for certain aspects of combat balancing complicated.  Reduce max speed^(3) to 150 m/s, and turning is harder the faster your ship is moving, scaling up with the mass of your ship. Turn speed gains a mass cap like we have now for ship speeds.

&#x200B;

**Section 4\] Rock Paper Scissors**

By significantly reducing ship speeds, weapon range can have more of an impact, since you can't simply close the gap in a few seconds. Due to technical limitations of IsR, max possible range of any weapon is 4km, but that still leaves enough wiggle room for significant differences. Some other RPS balance options in IsR are things like RoF, accuracy, countermeasures (torpedoes could have significant range and damage compared to other weapons, but are vulnerable to being shot down or disrupted by an EMP burst), spool-up (railguns), travel time of the projectiles, extended cool-downs on ""super weapons"", and of course damage.

&#x200B;

**Section 5\] Specialization**

RPS balancing is hampered by weapon groups, since any benefits or negatives of choosing one weapon setup over another are non-existent when you can have 10 possible weapon arrangements. Limit ships to one weapon group. There is the option to adjust what weapons are active in a group in game already, so you wouldn't have to return to port to change armaments, but it shouldn't be fast enough to easily do so in combat.

&#x200B;

**Section 6\] Shields**

Shields should remain tied to the CPU system, but CPU cost could be reduced, and shields should have more flexibility. Add a slider to shield gens, one end marked regen rate, one end marked max capacity. Slider should be synced across all shield gens. If you expect to be dealing with high RoF weapons, increase regen rate. Someone's coming after you with a railgun alpha-strike ship, crank up the capacity. Once your shields hit 0, it takes considerably longer for them to come back online. (Devs are already planning that one.)  Ion ammo and ammunition that deals different damage to shields than hull add unneeded complexity IMO.

&#x200B;

**Section 7\] Hacking**

Hacking is an interesting tool for combat balancing, as everyone is ""equal"", assuming you limit everyone to one cyber terminal. Some improvements are needed however. Add a hacking screen in the cockpit so you don't need to dedicate a crew member to hacking to get any use out of it. Some skill aspect could also be added, like a simple [quick time event](https://youtu.be/_YQY-NYiM6c?t=5) that you can operate with just a single key. For the cards, instead of them being used as ammo for hacking, they could instead upgrade the terminal, increasing range, automatically preform the quicktime event when defending, increase max firewall health, reduce connection time, or reducing recovery time. You're limited to 8 slots with just one terminal, so you could potentially get quite creative with RPS balancing here as well.

&#x200B;

**Section 8\] Scanning, Visibility, and Stealth**

This is a mechanic that has always fascinated me because of the possibilities, and I really hope devs come back to the scanner mechanic in particular. Some ideas there: heat mechanic, when fully implemented, plays heavily into how you're detected at long ranges. Also could have active and passive scanners. Go active and you can more easily find and track other ships, but you turn into a light on a hill.

The cloak gen was frankly a massive letdown for me when it was released, as all the restrictions on it render it little more than a poor alternative to the station shield.

In my perfect world, cloak gen no longer has any affect at longer ranges, but it engages the ""deep cloak"" (clear shader) instantly. However, the cloak gen can only maintain a cloak for a limited amount of time, possibly dependent on the mass of the ship. Firing weapons no longer break cloak, but you could track the ship by looking at the weapon projectiles, looking for heat signatures, or large amounts of active scanning. Successfully hitting a cloaked ship would break it's cloak early.

&#x200B;

**Section 9\] Device Damage**

Like hacking, interior damage lends itself to being a balancing tool, but right now it has almost no impact on combat for a few reasons. Combat doesn't last long enough for the power loss from damaged devices to make an impact, many devices don't actually lose any functionality when damaged, and there's also the problem of how device damage is decided in the first place. Right now, interior devices take damage based on how close they are to the point of impact on the exterior. I believe it's a 3 meter sphere around the point of impact that determines what devices are damaged. This system does however mean you can prevent device damage entirely by surrounding your ship with exterior blocks more than 3m away from the actual interior of your ship.

I'm not sure what technical limitations are in place, but I'm going to presume that any system that can track the angle that a projectile hit at and create a straight line along which devices are damaged isn't possible. If it is possible, then please implement that. If it's not possible however, decide what devices are damaged are picked through RNG. For example, railguns deal high damage to only a few devices, while flak guns damage nearly every device onboard the ship but only a few points of damage each. Exterior devices could still be damaged based on proximity to impact.

&#x200B;

**Section 10\] Armor**

Since at this point almost all ship designs are going to have armor gens, and people have vaults full of nanobots, removing armor altogether is not really an option; and of course that would also be a fair amount of wasted modeling work. Some ideas for replacement uses for them:

* Armor gens provide additional hull points based on a percentage value of the ships default hull value. Shouldn't be extreme, dedicating 100% of your CPU to armor would get you max 50% bonus hull.
* Armor remains a separate value, and the amount of armor you have determines how much device damage you take. Certain weapon and ammunition types would deal armor damage in addition to standard damage, or possibly ignore armor altogether when dealing interior damage.

**Section 11\] Ship Repair and Support Devices**

Ship repair in IsR is something that doesn't really have too much impact because you can just salvage the ship, and there's also a significant amount of disparity between the various existing options for ship repair. Add some incentive to keep players from always salvaging their ship, and

This is an area that doesn't really have any existing systems in IsR, but I hope to see them eventually. This would be an area capital ships could excel at.  These would be ""weapons"" which cost CPU, but could beam extra power and shields to other ships, and repair hull and interior devices.

**Section 12\] Warping**

Remove warp disruption on hit. It's an overly complicated mechanic that the victim doesn't have any out of unless his ship is incredibly maneuverable. For T0 and T1 NPC enemies players are still going to be ""poor"" enough that forcing them to fight runs the high risk of costing them their ship which will most likely be all they have at that moment.

**Section 13\] Rifting**

Just a couple possibles solutions the issue of using rifting as an easy out to combat. First is, let us blow up rifts. If you shoot a rift, the damage (x2 or x3 since damage values are a little small compared to mass values) is subtracted from the mass of the rift. If that's not possible, apply the old warp disruption on hit mechanic to rifting, though maybe only when shields are down.",2019-02-22 01:15:08,2,0,-0.9972,-1,-1,1.0
10048,InterstellarRift,"Event Horizon, now with PvE starter systems

Hello, I'm NathanIsOnline, host of Event Horizon, the longest running active player-run IsR server, and we're second only to the official PvE server in regular player count. Whether you're new to Interstellar Rift or are just coming back to it, you're welcome to join Event Horizon.

Event Horizon is a PvP server, with some special additions with the long term goal to create end-game content for players, and more importantly, fleets. This is done through our organizations. You can create your own organization with a couple other people, or join an existing one. Organizations can design their own HQs with Vaults, Store-o-Trons, and other admin devices; go to war with other organizations\*; design and launch invulnerable trading stations near the HSC Industrial Complex in Vectron Sxy; and participate in occasional server events, both PvP and PvE. Speaking of PvE; Vectron Syx, Sentinel Prime, and Alpha Ventura are all PvE\*\* on Event Horizon, giving you the option to get started without the worry of pirates.  


Interested? Come check us out:  [https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW](https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW)  


\*Bit of a work in progress. I've never had the player count in any two organizations to pull off full scale warfare between them. Time zones really wreck havoc on any system.

# Interstellar Rift Beta FAQ

[Interstellar Rift Beta FAQ Nov '18](https://preview.redd.it/fagjql3bk4z11.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=df9c128b4558123b391652061bcaf4a4780c37ce)

This FAQ has been approved by Hurles and contains updated information.

**Q: What is Interstellar Rift**

A: Interstellar Rift is a space simulation game where you can gather resources, construct your own ship from the inside out, help build space stations with a crew of friends or play solo to further your goals, in a procedurally generated galaxy.

Here is the Beta trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs)

**Q: On what platform(s) will Interstellar Rift be available?**

A: Interstellar Rift is currently available on Steam, for Windows PC.

**Q: When will Interstellar Rift be released?**

A: Interstellar Rift went into Steam Early Access, then entered Beta on October 11, 2018, and is slated for a full release sometime later.

**Q: Will I be able to play in single player?**

A: Yes, however the game is focusing on multiplayer; the single player game content is the same as multiplayer, but your game will not appear in the server list, so it will not have other players joining. You can build stations and do missions for various factions to build reputation, all while defending from occasional alien incursions. We have plans for narrative driven missions however we will reveal more about those once we are closer to implementing them.

**Q: Is Interstellar Rift an MMO?**

A: Interstellar Rift is not an MMO, but there is persistence for as long as a server is active and the save not reset. Players are currently playing on servers which have been persistent for two years! Servers will be privately hosted by players and we aim to support up to 64 players at a time, at launch. This number may increase later down the line.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**

A: Minimum and Recommended specs are as follows:

MINIMUM:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: Intel Dual Core 2GHz
* Memory: 4 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 440 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 2 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

RECOMMENDED:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: AMD or Intel Quad Core
* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 5 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

You maybe be able to play the game on a system that does not meet the minimum requirements however we cannot guarantee that.

**Q: Can I walk around inside my own ship?**

A: Yes, you and your crew can get up and walk around the interior of your own custom starship while underway, at any speed.

**Q: What can I do inside my starship?**

A: Ship interior gameplay is an integral part of Interstellar Rift. You can take control of different ship systems, gather different types of resources, repair broken systems, use gun turrets, operate missile launchers, build and dispatch drones, defend your ship from aliens and hostile boarders, trade with other players who you can teleport aboard, or just socialize with your crew.

**Q: How many ships can I have? Can I change them?**

A: You can have as many ships as you wish to build! You can modify your current ship anytime, as long as you have the materials and you can get everyone off the ship, onto a station with a modification terminal, so the upgrade work can be done to the ship.

**Q: Can I attack other players and board their ship?**

A: Yes, once you have disabled and hacked another player‚Äôs ship, you can teleport aboard and raid it, you can even steal their ship if you manage to disable their ability to respawn, but the same can happen to you!

**Q: Is this game a first person shooter?**

A: The entire game is in first person. Boarding another player‚Äôs ship without permission can result in hostility which you can indeed resolve with the use of FPS gameplay mechanics. Aliens may penetrate and infect ship systems, which you will have to locate and destroy. But the game is not focused around first person shooter gameplay. Shooting another player is a choice not a requirement.

**Q: How will I gather resources?**

A: Ships can be equipped with sensors, resource extractors, gas cloud harvesters and refinery equipment. These can gather resources, mine asteroids and produce construction materials. There is a massive strip mining system for producing very large quantities of building materials, and ram scoops for gathering or mixing gases for rare materials as well. You can also build large drone bays and drones, to dispatch and gather resources or defend you. Defeating aliens provides an opportunity to use a salvaging system to recover unique materials and some common types as well. You can also raid cargo from other players, space stations or trade for different resources.

**Q: Will I be able to build space stations?**

A: Yes, if you have gathered enough materials to construct a station, you can build it on site, or with a cockpit and engines to fly to your launch location. You can provide power from solar panels and fix the position with a gravity anchor. The process is nearly identical to ship construction. You can use the ship editor terminal to customize it similar to how you construct a ship. You can add weapons to it and there is even an invulnerable station shield, but you will need special crystals to fuel it.

**Q: What stops me from creating a kilometer long ship completely covered in guns that will own everything that gets near it?**

A: Practicality. Every ship in Interstellar Rift requires power and oxygen, and CPU to operate the shields and weapons. The bigger your ship, the higher the requirements. Projectile weapons, missiles and lasers require ammunition and energy shields drain considerable power from the system. Opening a rift to travel to another star in such a ship would be incredibly expensive in resources. Nothing prevents you from creating a giant ship like that, but whether or not you can maintain and defend it is the question.

**Q: My ship was destroyed/stolen. What now?**

A: If your ship has an escape pod, you can fly away and salvage the pod for some materials to start. You can purchase or build another ship. If you have the resources in your vault, you can build another ship from your stored blueprints at the ship editor terminal. Each of the starter stations also has the equipment to allow you to quickly gather resources. You can save the resources to build a ship yourself or sell them to purchase another ship already constructed at the Store-o-Tron. Many faction stations also have a terminal which will allow you to take out a loan to get you flying sooner.

**Q: I have built this gorgeous ship, can I use it on other servers?**

A: Yes and No, you cannot use a ship on any other server but the one you built it on. However the blueprint for that ship is stored locally and will be available for you on every server you join. All you need to do is gather the materials again to build it. You can also share the blueprint files with others.

**Q: How will space travel work?**

A: There are 3 modes of space travel in Interstellar Rift:

* Sublight travel: This is your normal cruising speed. In      this travel mode you will fight, mine and basically do everything. In this      mode you will have direct control over you ship and where it flies.
* Warp Travel: Warp is your main mode of transport within      a star system. It propels you faster than light and allows you to quickly      travel around a star system. In this mode you will have minimal control      over your ship.
* Hyperspace Jump: The hyperspace jump allows you to      travel between different star systems instantly through a rift created by      a rift generator. This is a point to point means of travel where the ship      is slowly flown through the created rift to a different star system. You      can still walk around inside the ship while the jump through a rift is      occurring.

**Q: Can I make videos using your game(s) and monetize them?**

A: Yes, we encourage people to make video‚Äôs using Split Polygon game content. However the video must be free to access by everyone. You cannot charge people to watch a video containing Split Polygon copyrighted materials. We also do not allow you to license these videos out to other parties for payment of any kind. You are free to monetize your video using the YouTube partner program, or similar services. This policy only applies to Interstellar Rift and Split Polygon related materials, any other content you choose to include in your video will require permission from the owner. If you want this by email confirmation please don't hesitate to ask.

Spelling and grammar in some of the loading hints, including the one about cargo slowing your ship down (its = it's). In fact, much of the dialogue in the tutorial has grammar mistakes. Perhaps you should post it all in a wiki and let the community offer suggested fixes?

Maybe keep a public scoreboard of the richest dudes on the server and make competitions or events or whatever.

Anyway my question to you is, are there any sort of server administration frameworks for IR or will I have to code this stuff myself? I do code for a living so it's not out of the question.

10074,InterstellarRift,"Idea: Battery station & Battery pack

Hello,

First off all, i'm pretty new to IR.
I think it would be a cool idea if you could build a ""battery station"". This station would be able tk create ""battery packs"". You can take the battery packs in your inventory, store them on cargo pads or place them in another battery station.
This would mean when creating a battery pack, you will take stored power from that power group or give the extra power to a powergroup.
To be able to add power to a battery station you need available space in batteries or powercells.

10077,InterstellarRift,"Ship Building thoughts

Hello, I am a relative noob. I have had Interstellar Rift for a little over half a year and have played around with it here and there, but recently I have been getting more into it. One of the things that keeps drawing me in is Ship Building. So I wanted to spark a discussion about Ship Building. A few questions I want to reach out and ask:

1. What speed range do you generally try to keep your ships in? I personally like to make sure my builds can stay between 140 ~ 300 m/s depending on the style of ship I'm building. I personally never like my ships being rated slower than 140 m/s.

2. Do you draft out your designs before you build them, or do you prefer to go with the flow? I tend to draft my designs deck by deck in a graphing paper notebook before I build them. This has helped me better understand the editor as well.

3. What primary sources of power do you use for most of your ships? I struggled with this for a while and recently started strapping the huge Hydrogen Generators on my ships because the small generators and the solar panels don't seem to produce enough power to be worth it.

4. How to external design? All my ships look like blobs, unintentionally of course, but I wanted to know if you guys follow any design philosophies? Do your ships have a common design theme or concept when looked at from the outside?

5. This is more of a question of technical efficiency rather than preference, but is it worth putting the huge engines that you can place from systems? I only built 1 ship using these engines and they didn't seem to be that good. I much prefer the engines you can place from exterior mode.",2018-02-15 21:41:19,4,0,0.9854,1,1,1.0

10103,InterstellarRift,"Steam Sale Noob - My Take on IR

Myself and my hubby purchased Interstellar Rift the other day from the Steam sale. Here's my take on the game so far. *Take my comments with a pinch, I'm well versed playing EA/Alpha games, but also I'm only 25 ish hours in.*

Wow, first of all. Wow! The look of the game is fantastic. Really truly, what a good looking game. 
One of my utter favourite things is how your character interacts with systems and consoles. Really putting the immersion there. I play games mainly on RP servers with a solid group of RP players, some of whom have also purchased IR in the Steam Sale. I see a great opportunity for RP play within this game, if only my character could punch!  
I play as an engineer. My Hubby pilots the boat, (my driving usually gets us killed so I'll leave that to him and I'll take care of the ship).  
I have found Interstellar Rift to be quite persistent with drawing me in to play it. The Ship Editor is fantastic, [I built a small ship](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=958327993) (Tel'Tek Stargate style I plan to upload on the workshop after testing in game), had a really lovely evening designing and tweaking that ship, but then all of a sudden I realised I had missed dinner, forgotten about the real world and it's 4am and I have to go to work in 3 hours....  
There are missions to play through, I can't mention much on this as I have not touched that in game yet, but again it's a lovely addition, bringing content into play.

I was surprised by the lack of player base out there, I do hope the Steam Summer sale helps this game get some attention.

**What's difficult with the game:**  
As it's in development I'm not going to say much here, having a good time playing an unfinished/Alpha/EA game is simply something people strongly differ on, it's like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Or in the way of EA games, you either deal with the bugs/issues or you don't. All I can say is if you see/experience a bug or issue, report it. Split Polygon have a forum for bug reports, and also the Dev's seem to be very responsive to bug reports, at least acknowledging them even if they cannot address them instantly.

This game is not particularly (in it's current state) beginner friendly. Server setup is a bit finicky. Navigation is tricky and there's a lot to learn about the game, especially all the systems and resources, but this is something time will cure, a steep learning curve is something I prefer, but the introductions given are adequate enough to get you started and not spoil it all in the process.

**Looking forward to:**  
Navigational improvements.  
Being able to punch someone (something I missed straight away, not being able to punch my friends or Hubby for no good reason).  
Being able to take my character's helmet off... Would bring in more immersion and also would provide the danger for possible issues if something went wrong with the ship.
 
**Would I recommend this game?**
To a person who was OK with playing an EA/Alpha game, yes. To those who are not, just wait and follow this game's progress, keep an eye on it, I'm sure it's going to go far (*crosses-fingers for luck*).

10112,InterstellarRift,"Plugin To Clean Up Ships Around Starter Stations

Hey everyone,

So Chip asked me to make a plugin for his Reaper server that cleaned up all ships within 1000 meters of the starter stations.

I figured others may take interest in this plugin as well. I know that a lot of servers, (such as OurMind), have a policy to just destroy ships that are left unattended and offline around spawn. Hopefully this will make things easier for both the user and the admin :D

What it does is every 8 hours (configurable), it checks each ship within 3,000 meters (configurable) of each starter station to see if that ship is a.) unoccupied and b.) if the owner is offline. If both are true, it stores the ship in that starter station's vault.

The plugin works but it still needs quite a lot of testing so I would recommend holding off on using it until Chip and I can test it out a little bit more :) but it seems to work from initial testing.

You can check it out plus the source code on the Augtrix website:

Starting off, I've been loving all the activity these past few weeks! It's great to see people posting questions, and chatting about future updates here.

I've been thinking of more ways for us to drum up some more activity to help grow the community for both /r/InterstellarRift and the game as a whole, and one thing that I keep coming back to is having the subreddit host a monthly ship building challenge.

The idea would be for each month to have a specific theme, or limitation. One month, the challenge may be to build a ship that is entirely solar powered, the next to build a cheap mining station that can be deployed and anchored at a belt, or a ship that can travel over a 500 m/s but costs less than a certain amount of materials.

The competition would run from the 1st of each month, through the 21st, with either the ship that meets the requirements the best, or an online poll deciding the winner, who would be announced at the end of the month. As far as a prize goes, at the very least I could give the winner a custom flair saying they won the challenge for a certain month, as well as cataloguing all the winners on the subreddits wiki.

So I'd like to gauge how much interest there would be in something like this, as well as see if you guys have ideas as to some creative potential challenges?",2017-01-09 16:56:42,7,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

As we host a server, there have been a few people asking me, what do I do now that I have a decent ship? The short answer, Head for the stars!

But digging in, where should you go and how to go about it? A huge part of the game is exploring the many solar systems in the galaxy - there are so many! I've been to around 30 systems give/take, and I haven't scratched the surface of the galaxy yet!

You're going to need a Rift Generator, so if your ship doesn't have one, no problem, head to any station that has Rift Hub, Trans Sphere, or the like in the station's name. These stations have Rift Generators in them that anyone can use.

Using a holotable or the holomap in the rift generator, you can select a system, and see what factions, stations and minerals can be found there. Choosing a system with a higher chance of beryllium and nitrogen is a good first choice, so you can refine and stock up on Xanthium, which is part of the fuel the rift generator will need to operate. If your ship doesn't have a rift generator on board, you probably want a system with a rift hub type station as well, at least if you plan to return to Hadron without building a Rift Generator.

You can always sell common minerals and goods at trade stations to buy up smaller quantities of rare minerals you need to get your exploration ship built and fuel to open a rift. Sound like fun?

Give it a try!

Hello, I'm NathanIsOnline, host of Event Horizon, the longest running active player-run IsR server, and we're second only to the official PvE server in regular player count. Whether you're new to Interstellar Rift or are just coming back to it, you're welcome to join Event Horizon.

Event Horizon is a PvP server, with some special additions with the long term goal to create end-game content for players, and more importantly, fleets. This is done through our organizations. You can create your own organization with a couple other people, or join an existing one. Organizations can design their own HQs with Vaults, Store-o-Trons, and other admin devices; go to war with other organizations\*; design and launch invulnerable trading stations near the HSC Industrial Complex in Vectron Sxy; and participate in occasional server events, both PvP and PvE. Speaking of PvE; Vectron Syx, Sentinel Prime, and Alpha Ventura are all PvE\*\* on Event Horizon, giving you the option to get started without the worry of pirates.  


Interested? Come check us out:  [https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW](https://discord.gg/XBHc2VW)

Hey guys,   
For starters I am totally a fan of this game, I've played off and on for over the last year or so, (I say new player because all I do is just build a ship in the editor, and then not fire up the game for another 6 months or so), but I want to get my small group of friends into it. The biggest thing that would intrigue them is the multicrew combat.  


I haven't gotten into too much combat in the game, and noticed that certain weapons need crew (like turrets and reloading torpedos/missles) If the multicrew combat is pretty fun then I might be able to sell my friends on the game, but if that's not quite developed yet, then I think I'll need to let IR bake a bit longer before I can get my friends on board.",2019-07-17 19:03:02,7,0,0.9631,1,1,1.0
10165,InterstellarRift,"Steam Sale Noob - My Take on IR

Myself and my hubby purchased Interstellar Rift the other day from the Steam sale. Here's my take on the game so far. *Take my comments with a pinch, I'm well versed playing EA/Alpha games, but also I'm only 25 ish hours in.*

Wow, first of all. Wow! The look of the game is fantastic. Really truly, what a good looking game. 
One of my utter favourite things is how your character interacts with systems and consoles. Really putting the immersion there. I play games mainly on RP servers with a solid group of RP players, some of whom have also purchased IR in the Steam Sale. I see a great opportunity for RP play within this game, if only my character could punch!  
I play as an engineer. My Hubby pilots the boat, (my driving usually gets us killed so I'll leave that to him and I'll take care of the ship).  
I have found Interstellar Rift to be quite persistent with drawing me in to play it. The Ship Editor is fantastic, [I built a small ship](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=958327993) (Tel'Tek Stargate style I plan to upload on the workshop after testing in game), had a really lovely evening designing and tweaking that ship, but then all of a sudden I realised I had missed dinner, forgotten about the real world and it's 4am and I have to go to work in 3 hours....  
There are missions to play through, I can't mention much on this as I have not touched that in game yet, but again it's a lovely addition, bringing content into play.

I was surprised by the lack of player base out there, I do hope the Steam Summer sale helps this game get some attention.

**What's difficult with the game:**  
As it's in development I'm not going to say much here, having a good time playing an unfinished/Alpha/EA game is simply something people strongly differ on, it's like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Or in the way of EA games, you either deal with the bugs/issues or you don't. All I can say is if you see/experience a bug or issue, report it. Split Polygon have a forum for bug reports, and also the Dev's seem to be very responsive to bug reports, at least acknowledging them even if they cannot address them instantly.

This game is not particularly (in it's current state) beginner friendly. Server setup is a bit finicky. Navigation is tricky and there's a lot to learn about the game, especially all the systems and resources, but this is something time will cure, a steep learning curve is something I prefer, but the introductions given are adequate enough to get you started and not spoil it all in the process.

**Looking forward to:**  
Navigational improvements.  
Being able to punch someone (something I missed straight away, not being able to punch my friends or Hubby for no good reason).  
Being able to take my character's helmet off... Would bring in more immersion and also would provide the danger for possible issues if something went wrong with the ship.
 
**Would I recommend this game?**
To a person who was OK with playing an EA/Alpha game, yes. To those who are not, just wait and follow this game's progress, keep an eye on it, I'm sure it's going to go far (*crosses-fingers for luck*).

## Heist Aboard the Trafalgar

Echelon Company reports that one of their ships was found to have been boarded, looted and damaged late on the 9th of June. Could this be the result of independent hackers, or was it an inside job? Interstellar Newsline is here reporting on the investigation.

The Trafalgar is Echelon Company‚Äôs only active warship and was in the process of conducting long term nuclear reactor trials in an attempt to breed superior nuclear fuels, according to one EC representative. The stolen goods amount to over 30 U-238, 15 Pu-239, 1 Pu-241, 100 standard torpedos, 50 rounds of railgun bolts and 10 T3 heat sinks. Estimates of the value of goods lost put the cost between 100 and 125 Million units and damages in excess of 800,000 units.

Echelon Company stated that the Trafalgar has been put back into service as a combat vessel for escort and stealth operations. Prior to the incident the fuel was intended to fuel EC‚Äôs interests over the next few weeks as they industrialize and improve their ship building capabilities. Echelon Company declined to comment on suspects of the heist, but had the following to say: ‚ÄúI implore independent pilots and faction aligned pilots alike to develop \[their\] own security protocols for \[their ships\] if \[they\] are unable to store them in a station.‚Äù

## Traffic Collision Results in Destroyed Ship at HSC Industrial Complex

Monday, June 10th

Echelon Company lost a ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù class industrial ship today following a traffic collision at the HSC Industrial Complex in Vectron Syx.

The Commodore was parked at the HSC Industrial Complex and was collided into by a Quartermaster class industrial ship piloted by Turkey Sandvich, CEO of the Long-Limb Roe Acquisition Specialists faction. Station police records show that Mr. Sandvich has been involved in numerous collision incidents at the station in the past, but never any that resulted in the destruction of a ship. A police representative stated that the station telemetry recorded that the damage which was done only amounted to 6HP. This indicates that the destroyed ship was already in a very weakened state or had its defensive systems offline prior to the collision.

Mr. Sandvich stated that ‚Äúderelicts should not be parked in a congested area like that around the HSC station. It could pose a danger to any parking ships if they were to explode like this one.‚Äù The two involved parties have settled the matter privately.

## Materials Lost Aboard the AprilDan and her Sister Ship

Another two Echelon Company ships this week were looted while mining cloaked in deep space.

Materials lost aboard both ships amount to at least 7.5 Million Units in T3 materials and ammo. Nuclear rods and hydrogen had to be replaced and damage was sustained due to a skrill attack following the theft according to the Echelon Company Public Information Office. When asked about potential suspects, a statement made by the office stated: ‚ÄúWe have no clue who could have found us to do this.  We have locked all company vaults to only company officers.‚Äù

The ECPIO further stated that both ships have been put back into service to replace the lost fuel rods and materials and said ‚ÄúBoth ships are in space dock hopefully engineers and IT specialists can help identify the guilty party.  Justice will be swift in league with the old ‚ÄòShock and Awe‚Äô type of retribution.‚Äù

S3 investigators looking into the theft commented that the ship‚Äôs logs show that one of the ship‚Äôs cloaking devices was disrupted by the launch of a mining drone. This could have allowed a hacker to find the ship and gain access to steal the materials. They went on to state, however, that they are not ruling out the possibility of an inside-job at this time.

In the wake of multiple ship robberies and thefts this week, Interstellar News would like to remind pilots that proper storage of ships is a key to security. Hackers and traitors are all around us and the possibility for theft is always present. If you can‚Äôt afford to lose it, don‚Äôt leave it sitting around!",2019-06-15 19:54:30,8,0,-0.9867,-1,-1,1.0

10179,InterstellarRift,"Life beyond Hadron; where to go when your ready to explore

As we host a server, there have been a few people asking me, what do I do now that I have a decent ship? The short answer, Head for the stars!

But digging in, where should you go and how to go about it? A huge part of the game is exploring the many solar systems in the galaxy - there are so many! I've been to around 30 systems give/take, and I haven't scratched the surface of the galaxy yet!

You're going to need a Rift Generator, so if your ship doesn't have one, no problem, head to any station that has Rift Hub, Trans Sphere, or the like in the station's name. These stations have Rift Generators in them that anyone can use.

Using a holotable or the holomap in the rift generator, you can select a system, and see what factions, stations and minerals can be found there. Choosing a system with a higher chance of beryllium and nitrogen is a good first choice, so you can refine and stock up on Xanthium, which is part of the fuel the rift generator will need to operate. If your ship doesn't have a rift generator on board, you probably want a system with a rift hub type station as well, at least if you plan to return to Hadron without building a Rift Generator.

You can always sell common minerals and goods at trade stations to buy up smaller quantities of rare minerals you need to get your exploration ship built and fuel to open a rift. Sound like fun?

Give it a try!

10181,InterstellarRift,"Public Service Announcement

Public Service Announcement:

So after spending a lot of time, resources, money and close calls I lost my prize ship today. It was 125 blocks in length, 45 blocks in width 2 x drone bays, 2 x Large Shields, 1 x Station Shield, cloak over 600,000 k hydrogen tank capacity for extended trips, ship storage system, armed to the teeth, 4 x refineries, 4 x extractors complete multipurpose ship. Well over 5.5 mil to insure (didn't insure it  couldn't afford to)

&#x200B;

So why is this a public service announcement? Well after surviving an onslaught of Skrill with torpedo's and missiles in a T3 system I rifted into a relatively safe T2 system to do some mining and collect resources, refuel etc. Parked at the mining station, activated station shields, deployed drones, started extracting water to make fuel for my 4 x Extra Large Hydrogen tanks.

&#x200B;

10 x Skrill attack, my weapons are dropping their numbers but my station shield is not online (10 min to go), so I turn off the shield and start running, manage to destroy them all then get back to my parking spot. Engage station shield and start doing repairs etc. After 9 minutes I hear guns, thinking oh more skrill, next my shields are going down I jump to the cockpit no skrill??? WTF??? see a swarm of protection drones all red around me shooting me. Did I leave my guns on? Did I accidently shoot the station? No to both my guns were off I was 800 m from station so why are these drones attacking me??!!???! I attempt to run, call for repair drones to repair the ship but more drones arrive only to attack me and worse they took my credits so WTF I paid to be attacked? No it wasn't a reputation issue I was at 3500 rep for my faction and around 1500 for all the other factions. So after freaking out I ran around the ship and noticed the Skrill had infected my ship with their internal creatures. After removing them the drones continued to attack me, apparently awaiting the cooldown timer, so once again I request repairs from the service....cost me 4.5 million for the service call. Guess what more drones appeared and started attacking me needless to say I died, my ship was destroyed and now am broke sitting in the station going WTF just happened.

&#x200B;

So long story short what I have learned and am guessing the issue was if your ship is infected by the Skrill, the AI considers you as an enemy and will attack you so anytime you are attacked and your shields go down, do yourself a favor stay away from stations until you have done a complete check of your ship for the internal parasites otherwise you will end up in the same situation I was in getting attacked and not knowing why.

&#x200B;

Will I recover? Absolutely I have another great ship in another system in storage and I have always dumped my high value resources into my vault or my freighter then store my ship in the station for protection.

Hey ya all. Quick question with long explanation.

We all know that later in game making specialised ships isn't really useful. We got materials, we got money, we got all we need in quantities wchich exceed usage. So, this question will be divided into two questions.

1. At early game, do you think it's better to specialize ships to avoid some costs, like fuel and materials?
2. Later in game, do you specialize your ships? For example, for convienience (so you don't have to run miles around ship), cost (fuel, coolant etc.) or to avoid potential cost of loosing said ship? (PvP)

I am just curious. And I tend to specialize my ships in both cases, because I like building them so yeah. But what about you all?",2020-11-23 15:53:38,7,0,0.61,1,1,1.0

The devs announced that in response to the continued requests to adding planetary landing to IsR, they would remove the planets entirely in an attempt to get players to shut up about them.

The PvP mode is being phased out in an attempt to appeal to a younger, more impatient audience.

""We're also removing the Geoff droids from the game, as too many players were confused as to why they couldn't walk around and refused to wrap their undeveloped minds around the idea that pathfinding was impossible without requiring large code rewrites, insisting 'minecraft does it!?!?!@!'"".

Bones has been made IsR's new community moderator, with developers citing ""anyone who ticks off that many people must be doing something right"". Bones moved to immediately ban all facts that disagreed with her opinions. ""They'er just bullys, facts aren't rael (sic)""

Conquintor, lighting up a cigar with $100 bills, had an important announcement:""We've sold out to Epic Games in order to fund development of our next project, IsR Battle Royale. Interstellar Rift will continue *cough* ""active"" development, but expect this new project to take up more of our time in the coming months. Some ISR BR features will be able to make it into the original game however. For example, we plan to allow skins purchased in the BR store to be used in the original game, allowing you to look ~~like an idiot~~ your best in both games!""

The original Interstellar Rift will still be available for purchase on Steam though, right?""LOL, no. How else is Epic supposed to beat Steam? By actually improving their store or something? LOL, when pigs fly""

Concerns were raised immediately about players who owned the game on Steam and didn't want to switch to the Epic Store. Hurles, chugging a bottle of champagne, was quick to allay fears:""All players who already own the game on Steam will still be able to play the game as normal. However, to ensure a universal experience for our Epic players, the IsR Steam Workshop is being removed effective immediately. If you used the workshop as a backup for ship designs, you should have known better. Designs are not recoverable.""",2019-05-17 05:58:09,6,0,0.9905,1,1,1.0

Extractors can now be told to stop mining and dump the remaining resources into space. You can also tell the extractor to mine a resource out of a rock out of order, so you can skip straight to the gold or platinum. It doesn't appear to have any ties to automation cards, so this will require manual operation.  
The refinery has a new feature where you can set the target value higher than the total resources in the refinery's buffer. So long as there's some of the raw resource(s) needed in the buffer, the refinery will keep mining until the target value is reached. ""Doesn't this allow you to skip on using automation cards for refineries?"" Sort of. If the you fall behind a bit and the buffer runs out, the refinery will stop and will not attempt to start up again later. An automation card will prompt the refinery to keep busy. The automation card also enables the refinery to handle multiple types of resources.  
Also coming next patch, automation cards for the cargo teleporters!   
[https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu](https://clips.twitch.tv/MiniatureExpensiveAubergineAllenHuhu)  
Fairly straightforward, you can select nearby ships as destinations, even select vaults as a destination. Apparently the card somehow tracks the Steam ID to ensure it goes to the right person's vault. Apparently it even remembers the settings if you go out of range of the other ship, though it sounds like if the ship rifts to another system and rifts back it breaks.   


A ""match speed to target"" function is coming, actually two functions. One matches your ship's speed to the current speed of the target, the other tries to keep your ship's speed in sync with the target, even if the target changes speed. (They attempted to show this off in the steam, it's not *quite* finished yet. It makes the ship's go *a* speed, just not the speed they actually want to go. They're getting there.)

Things were going swimingly on the devstream right up until the \~35 minute mark when they tried to engage some Skrill. This is when they discovered that the workshop ship they were using had never actually been used in combat, as evidenced by the fact that it's ammo loaders weren't assigned to a group. Take note kiddies, never trust a workshop ship without extensive testing.Said ship also claimed the life of poor Sentinel, as they discovered one of the floor fans either had it's own life support group (yes that's a thing) or was not assigned to the life support group. Don't trust workshop ships.

Sentinel was revealed to apparently be a giant, requiring a reinforced chair and is apparently too tall to ride on roller-coasters.

They (hopefully) fixed the problem with drones not warping properly.)

10200,InterstellarRift,"Plugin To Clean Up Ships Around Starter Stations

Hey everyone,

So Chip asked me to make a plugin for his Reaper server that cleaned up all ships within 1000 meters of the starter stations.

I figured others may take interest in this plugin as well. I know that a lot of servers, (such as OurMind), have a policy to just destroy ships that are left unattended and offline around spawn. Hopefully this will make things easier for both the user and the admin :D

What it does is every 8 hours (configurable), it checks each ship within 3,000 meters (configurable) of each starter station to see if that ship is a.) unoccupied and b.) if the owner is offline. If both are true, it stores the ship in that starter station's vault.

The plugin works but it still needs quite a lot of testing so I would recommend holding off on using it until Chip and I can test it out a little bit more :) but it seems to work from initial testing.

You can check it out plus the source code on the Augtrix website:

10201,InterstellarRift,"Interest in a monthly ship-building challenge?

Starting off, I've been loving all the activity these past few weeks! It's great to see people posting questions, and chatting about future updates here.

I've been thinking of more ways for us to drum up some more activity to help grow the community for both /r/InterstellarRift and the game as a whole, and one thing that I keep coming back to is having the subreddit host a monthly ship building challenge.

The idea would be for each month to have a specific theme, or limitation. One month, the challenge may be to build a ship that is entirely solar powered, the next to build a cheap mining station that can be deployed and anchored at a belt, or a ship that can travel over a 500 m/s but costs less than a certain amount of materials.

The competition would run from the 1st of each month, through the 21st, with either the ship that meets the requirements the best, or an online poll deciding the winner, who would be announced at the end of the month. As far as a prize goes, at the very least I could give the winner a custom flair saying they won the challenge for a certain month, as well as cataloguing all the winners on the subreddits wiki.

So I'd like to gauge how much interest there would be in something like this, as well as see if you guys have ideas as to some creative potential challenges?",2017-01-09 16:56:42,5,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

10214,InterstellarRift,"Changes to the Event Horizon IsR server

IsR 1.0 is launching on September 24th. In an attempt to capitalize on the increased player traffic that the launch will (hopefully) bring, there are going to be considerable changes to how Event Horizon ([http://event-horizon.site](http://event-horizon.site), [https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) operates. This includes a full wipe of the main EH server, though players won't necessarily be starting over with zero resources (more details on that below).

The goals of these changes are to encourage longer term player retention, encourage more regular player interactions (both PvE and PvP interactions), and to give long term goals/achievements for players and organizations. 

These changes will include (but are not necessarily limited to):

‚Ä¢Fewer star systems in the EH galaxy (currently looking at about 4-6 ""useful"" systems in total).

‚Ä¢A new central star system (Hadron) that all players will start in.

‚Ä¢Limited resource spawns in the asteroid belts (both of type and quantity).

‚Ä¢Seasons of PvP and PvE (though there will be one permanent PvE star system, and one permanent PvP star system).

‚Ä¢Addition of randomly spawning, short lived, asteroid fields; same as the ones that spawn at NPC mining stations. Note that these fields will have more than just T0 resources. These will spawn in random locations, encouraging players to seek them out and compete with other groups to mine them.

‚Ä¢Return of server events, such as PvP tournaments, but also PvE events.

‚Ä¢A new unique currency (Eventium) on the server, represented by a custom resource. Players can earn this currency in various ways, including trading with/stealing from other players. Players will be able to trade Eventium in for other resources, but they will also be able to use it to purchase custom stations, purchase special services, or use it to purchase resources after the wipes. Automated scripts will be in place to help with many of these Eventium transactions, which will hopefully allow it to be considerably more useful. 

Not all of these changes will be present on Event Horizon as soon as 1.0 launches, and are subject to change based on what 1.0 adds and how many players EH can attract with the 1.0 launch. The current EH server will continue as is until the 24th, and will probably still be left online, at least temporarily, after the 1.0 launch. The new server will simply take its place on the 24th.

(Potentially) Frequently Asked Questions:

*Why are you wiping the server? I don't want to start over again!*

The server wipe does two things: the first (and primary) reason is that it allows me to create a new IsR server and work on setting it up over the next few weeks, without needing to worry about preserving/transferring/losing player progress. The second reason is that it's encouraging for new players to know that everyone else on the server don't have a massive advantage over them; and for many existing players it's more engaging to have a fresh start. 

That said, I know starting completely over in IsR can be a bit of a grind, so starter packs will be given out to existing players, based on how long they've been on the Discord. If you left the Discord and then came back later on, I'll still count it. The exact amount and type of resources in the starter packs has yet to be decided, but it will be based on the tier system. 2+ years equals T3, 1+ year equals T2, 6+ months equals T1, and anyone arriving before the launch of 1.0 will get some T0 resources. More details on that can be found on the EH Discord ([https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS](https://discord.gg/Sq4FMpS)) leading up to the 1.0 launch.

*Why are you having so few star systems, other servers have hundreds!*

The huge number of star systems that IsR spawns by default is actually a problem with IsR, even if you assume a server regularly has 64 players (something that has never happened). Star systems in IsR are already so enormous that you could put the full 64 players in a single star system, remove signatures and transponders, and it would be practically impossible to find another player. Even in Vectron Syx on popular servers the only time you'll run into another player is when they're back at HSC IC to rearm/store their ship. The rest of the time players are scattered across the stars. On a server with even 50 star systems PvP is practically impossible, and even just trying to meet up with other players to trade with/crew with them is a chore.   
Having infinite star systems also equals infinite resources, which completely removes any reason to interact with other players for resources. Why trade with/fight with other players for resources when you can just as easily (or even easier) mine them yourself by finding a system with a high rating of your target resource?

*What special services?*  
Good question. I haven't thought of very many at the moment, it would be things like allowing players to rename planets/stars, and to have the Skrill/faction rating of a system adjusted. I'm sure players will give me other ideas as we go forwards.  
*PvP/PvE seasons?*  
This is an idea I acquired from other Empyrion servers during that brief period where I hosted an Emp server for EH (apologies to those players who wanted such a server for longer, it proved to be more effort than I was willing to give, especially as Empyrion was a game I didn't find very engaging).  
The star systems on Event Horizon will cycle between majority PvE and majority PvP toggle on a regular cycle. If you're not interested in engaging in PvP, you can still play on Event Horizon, but PvP players will get bonus Eventium and other rewards for beating other groups. There will also be changes to encourage raids of other org's stations during PvP seasons.

  
*""After the wipes""? What wipes?*

This is the one change I'm not fully decided on. I'm considering having the server wipe every so often, with a handful of things carrying over, like Eventium. I'm not fully convinced that the benefits of this outweigh the downsides, but at minimum these wipes would only take place every 6 months at the minimum; most likely even rarer.

If you have other questions about the event, you can also ask them there.  
**You do not have to be an existing Event Horizon player to participate.** This event will be taking place on a creative server, and you will be allowed to spawn in your ship designs and whatever ammo and resource you need to power it before the event starts. *The server will have creative mode turned* ***off*** *as soon as the event begins.

Participants will be divided among three teams, each with their own nearly invulnerable (but hack-able and board-able) station. A neutral central station will be producing **the Spice** at regular intervals. You'll need to hack the station, gather as much **Spice** as you can carry, and bring it back to your team's station. Alternatively you can attack the other teams' ships and stations and try to steal **the Spice** from them. The choice is yours.  
There will be three \~30 minute rounds to determine the winning team.  
All participants will receive RT\_AdvancedAmmo as a prize (amount dependent on your team's finishing position) on the main Event Horizon server.   
A few ground rules on allowed ships and equipment: 1, no Unobtanium in your ship designs (hopefully that didn't need clarified); 2, no ships over 500k mass unloaded; and 3, no Repair Firewall cartridges. Repair Hacked Systems and Hack Firewall cartridges are permitted.\*  


See you then.  


\*Due to the current setup of hacking cartridges, having Repair Firewall cartridges makes you essentially immune to hack attempts. On a creative server where you could simply spawn more as needed, allowing them means hacking simply won't be an option for attackers, which obviously screws up my event rules a fair amount.",2019-06-01 02:54:26,5,0,0.8807,1,1,1.0

10224,InterstellarRift,"Couple Questions

Hey Folks,
A bunch of my friend circle picked up the game over the weekend and we're loving it so far.  Couple questions though.

- What are we missing with Silicon, we can't find it.
- Skrill are a pain and turn simple delivery missions into Russian Roulette (as we have no weapons, because we have no silicon)  How can we fix this?
- Is it possible to make doors auto-open on approach?

Ya so just put on some auto turrets and as I was modifying some other stuff my ship must have fired on faction drones. Or they accidently hit me and then my turrets returned fire.

And ship was crippled...750k repair.Had to pay for an increase in status, which I didn't know you could do...But now was delisted from Hurles and at neutral pts again...
So the question would be is there a way to make sure turrets don't fire at friendlies at all even if they accidently hit you? If not...that needs to be in...what a waste of time...bah.

Update: So after some trial and error I figured out you can seperate them in different groups with two separate cpus and loaders. I have one standard group and one for autos.  Switching between the groups will have one on and the other group with cpu offline! So far no problems. But I still play it safe with guns off near station drones lol...I started the separation in the editor power config, then tweaked it on board the weapons cpu to make sure i had the right ones in their groups.

10246,InterstellarRift,"Event Horizon Ship Design Contest

Event Horizon is having a design contest to pick a ""replacement"" design for The Black Pit. For more details see [www.event-horizon.site](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.event-horizon.site).What: replacement Black Pit.When: now! Contest will end in about six weeks, but may be longer depending on how long it takes me to get my act together with the new server.Who: anyone who can build a station that isn't an eyesore.Reward: I'll get back to you on that. (There will be a reward of some sort, but I haven't had the time to put thought into what exactly.)Special Instructions: In order to ensure that nothing is broken, your new station must be built alongside the Black Pit. What this means is you need to load the Black Ship file, move over 20 squares, and start your design there. Players can use teleporters to cross from the original Black Pit to the new station.Design Requirements: the station needs to be easily navigated, no endless hallways. Need two large mining bays, similar to those on the HSC IC. No ACTRs, however make sure the new station has all the standard NPC terminals, as well as mission boards and drop boxes. 3D printers and assemblers are up to you as to whether or not you want to include them. Having an ""admin"" room with a transponder and a shield generator would be appreciated, but not necessarily required.You can use the following file to start with. MAKE SURE YOU START WITH THE FOLLOWING DESIGN AND MAKE NO CHANGES TO ITS INTERNALS. If you'd like to make changes to the exterior of the original Black Pit, i.e. ""attaching"" the two designs together with exterior blocks, that is acceptable.

# Interstellar Rift Beta FAQ

[Interstellar Rift Beta FAQ Nov '18](https://preview.redd.it/fagjql3bk4z11.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=df9c128b4558123b391652061bcaf4a4780c37ce)

This FAQ has been approved by Hurles and contains updated information.

**Q: What is Interstellar Rift**

A: Interstellar Rift is a space simulation game where you can gather resources, construct your own ship from the inside out, help build space stations with a crew of friends or play solo to further your goals, in a procedurally generated galaxy.

Here is the Beta trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnEwB3XzAAs)

**Q: On what platform(s) will Interstellar Rift be available?**

A: Interstellar Rift is currently available on Steam, for Windows PC.

**Q: When will Interstellar Rift be released?**

A: Interstellar Rift went into Steam Early Access, then entered Beta on October 11, 2018, and is slated for a full release sometime later.

**Q: Will I be able to play in single player?**

A: Yes, however the game is focusing on multiplayer; the single player game content is the same as multiplayer, but your game will not appear in the server list, so it will not have other players joining. You can build stations and do missions for various factions to build reputation, all while defending from occasional alien incursions. We have plans for narrative driven missions however we will reveal more about those once we are closer to implementing them.

**Q: Is Interstellar Rift an MMO?**

A: Interstellar Rift is not an MMO, but there is persistence for as long as a server is active and the save not reset. Players are currently playing on servers which have been persistent for two years! Servers will be privately hosted by players and we aim to support up to 64 players at a time, at launch. This number may increase later down the line.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**

A: Minimum and Recommended specs are as follows:

MINIMUM:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: Intel Dual Core 2GHz
* Memory: 4 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 440 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 2 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

RECOMMENDED:

* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Processor: AMD or Intel Quad Core
* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or higher
* Network: Broadband Internet connection
* Hard Drive: 5 GB available space
* Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.3 or higher required

You maybe be able to play the game on a system that does not meet the minimum requirements however we cannot guarantee that.

**Q: Can I walk around inside my own ship?**

A: Yes, you and your crew can get up and walk around the interior of your own custom starship while underway, at any speed.

**Q: What can I do inside my starship?**

A: Ship interior gameplay is an integral part of Interstellar Rift. You can take control of different ship systems, gather different types of resources, repair broken systems, use gun turrets, operate missile launchers, build and dispatch drones, defend your ship from aliens and hostile boarders, trade with other players who you can teleport aboard, or just socialize with your crew.

**Q: How many ships can I have? Can I change them?**

A: You can have as many ships as you wish to build! You can modify your current ship anytime, as long as you have the materials and you can get everyone off the ship, onto a station with a modification terminal, so the upgrade work can be done to the ship.

**Q: Can I attack other players and board their ship?**

A: Yes, once you have disabled and hacked another player‚Äôs ship, you can teleport aboard and raid it, you can even steal their ship if you manage to disable their ability to respawn, but the same can happen to you!

**Q: Is this game a first person shooter?**

A: The entire game is in first person. Boarding another player‚Äôs ship without permission can result in hostility which you can indeed resolve with the use of FPS gameplay mechanics. Aliens may penetrate and infect ship systems, which you will have to locate and destroy. But the game is not focused around first person shooter gameplay. Shooting another player is a choice not a requirement.

**Q: How will I gather resources?**

A: Ships can be equipped with sensors, resource extractors, gas cloud harvesters and refinery equipment. These can gather resources, mine asteroids and produce construction materials. There is a massive strip mining system for producing very large quantities of building materials, and ram scoops for gathering or mixing gases for rare materials as well. You can also build large drone bays and drones, to dispatch and gather resources or defend you. Defeating aliens provides an opportunity to use a salvaging system to recover unique materials and some common types as well. You can also raid cargo from other players, space stations or trade for different resources.

**Q: Will I be able to build space stations?**

A: Yes, if you have gathered enough materials to construct a station, you can build it on site, or with a cockpit and engines to fly to your launch location. You can provide power from solar panels and fix the position with a gravity anchor. The process is nearly identical to ship construction. You can use the ship editor terminal to customize it similar to how you construct a ship. You can add weapons to it and there is even an invulnerable station shield, but you will need special crystals to fuel it.

**Q: What stops me from creating a kilometer long ship completely covered in guns that will own everything that gets near it?**

A: Practicality. Every ship in Interstellar Rift requires power and oxygen, and CPU to operate the shields and weapons. The bigger your ship, the higher the requirements. Projectile weapons, missiles and lasers require ammunition and energy shields drain considerable power from the system. Opening a rift to travel to another star in such a ship would be incredibly expensive in resources. Nothing prevents you from creating a giant ship like that, but whether or not you can maintain and defend it is the question.

**Q: My ship was destroyed/stolen. What now?**

A: If your ship has an escape pod, you can fly away and salvage the pod for some materials to start. You can purchase or build another ship. If you have the resources in your vault, you can build another ship from your stored blueprints at the ship editor terminal. Each of the starter stations also has the equipment to allow you to quickly gather resources. You can save the resources to build a ship yourself or sell them to purchase another ship already constructed at the Store-o-Tron. Many faction stations also have a terminal which will allow you to take out a loan to get you flying sooner.

**Q: I have built this gorgeous ship, can I use it on other servers?**

A: Yes and No, you cannot use a ship on any other server but the one you built it on. However the blueprint for that ship is stored locally and will be available for you on every server you join. All you need to do is gather the materials again to build it. You can also share the blueprint files with others.

**Q: How will space travel work?**

A: There are 3 modes of space travel in Interstellar Rift:

* Sublight travel: This is your normal cruising speed. In      this travel mode you will fight, mine and basically do everything. In this      mode you will have direct control over you ship and where it flies.
* Warp Travel: Warp is your main mode of transport within      a star system. It propels you faster than light and allows you to quickly      travel around a star system. In this mode you will have minimal control      over your ship.
* Hyperspace Jump: The hyperspace jump allows you to      travel between different star systems instantly through a rift created by      a rift generator. This is a point to point means of travel where the ship      is slowly flown through the created rift to a different star system. You      can still walk around inside the ship while the jump through a rift is      occurring.

**Q: Can I make videos using your game(s) and monetize them?**

A: Yes, we encourage people to make video‚Äôs using Split Polygon game content. However the video must be free to access by everyone. You cannot charge people to watch a video containing Split Polygon copyrighted materials. We also do not allow you to license these videos out to other parties for payment of any kind. You are free to monetize your video using the YouTube partner program, or similar services. This policy only applies to Interstellar Rift and Split Polygon related materials, any other content you choose to include in your video will require permission from the owner. If you want this by email confirmation please don't hesitate to ask.

10254,InterstellarRift,"Ship Building thoughts

Hello, I am a relative noob. I have had Interstellar Rift for a little over half a year and have played around with it here and there, but recently I have been getting more into it. One of the things that keeps drawing me in is Ship Building. So I wanted to spark a discussion about Ship Building. A few questions I want to reach out and ask:

1. What speed range do you generally try to keep your ships in? I personally like to make sure my builds can stay between 140 ~ 300 m/s depending on the style of ship I'm building. I personally never like my ships being rated slower than 140 m/s.

2. Do you draft out your designs before you build them, or do you prefer to go with the flow? I tend to draft my designs deck by deck in a graphing paper notebook before I build them. This has helped me better understand the editor as well.

3. What primary sources of power do you use for most of your ships? I struggled with this for a while and recently started strapping the huge Hydrogen Generators on my ships because the small generators and the solar panels don't seem to produce enough power to be worth it.

4. How to external design? All my ships look like blobs, unintentionally of course, but I wanted to know if you guys follow any design philosophies? Do your ships have a common design theme or concept when looked at from the outside?

5. This is more of a question of technical efficiency rather than preference, but is it worth putting the huge engines that you can place from systems? I only built 1 ship using these engines and they didn't seem to be that good. I much prefer the engines you can place from exterior mode.",2018-02-15 21:41:19,4,0,0.9854,1,1,1.0
10255,InterstellarRift,"Automation Question

I am using automation cartridges for the first time in extractors and refineries. Neither system seems to do anything after I select a resource, or choose an ore to refine (I am turning automation on. All cartridges are degrading.) I went to The Black Pit and tried auto extracting water, only water selected, nothing happened.

Is there an issue with automation right now?
Am I missing something?

**It‚Äôs been a while since the last ship design contest, but we‚Äôre happy  to announce a new one. The contest will coincide with the next patch  (0.2.9) which will introduce derelict ships. We will be designing the  bulk of these, but to help us fill out the variety of vessels to  encounter, we need your help! This time we‚Äôll be electing multiple  winners, with 5 ships going into the game this time.**  


As the  previous contests only had a single winner, if you want a ship you  designed to be in the game, this is going to be one of the best chances  you‚Äôll get.   


The ships we‚Äôd like to see are smaller vessels, with  some cargo capacity, and an interesting interior layout, made up of  multiple corridors and rooms so players can explore them.   


Ship description:  
The  ships should be smaller rather than large, as we‚Äôd like these ships to  be explorable in a fairly short amount of time. The ship‚Äôs systems  should function normally, once you encounter one of these ships in the  game, we will dynamically damage some of the devices and place loot on  board. These ships can be made to fit with a certain faction, but we  have no style guide, and you are free to design the exterior to your  liking. You are allowed to use devices from all tiers, as the ships will  spawn in systems relative to the resources used in construction.  


Creating  interesting ways to navigate the ship to get to the loot areas, or  setting up puzzle like power systems to gain access is encouraged.   


Requirements:  
Ship requirements:

* At least 3 rooms.
* At least 2 cargo pads (or a minimum of 16 cargo slots)
* At least 1 locker (or a minimum of 8 tool slots)
* The ship should function normally, no permissions have to be set on devices.
* At least 1 teleporter
* Ship mass can not be more than 100K.  
Things not to do:  
No admin models.  
No holes or traps that can get players stuck.

Contest Rules:  
As with every contest there are rules and regulations that everyone must adhere to so here are ours.

* All submissions must be original, ships resembling established designs outside of Interstellar Rift will be disqualified
* The  contest will run until the 18th of June, any submission made after the  end date will be disqualified. We will be looking at the ships on the  Developer Stream on the 19th of June. 
* All Submissions may  NOT contain and of the following, graphic or sexually oriented imagery.  any depictions of or related to drug use, political views outside of  those present inside of Interstellar Rift. 
* Split Polygon reserves the right to alter any winning submission before implementing it into the game. 
* The contest is open to anyone.

10304,InterstellarRift,"Combat 3.0, or, what would happen if IsR was developed solely by me.

Basically writing this for fun, but hopefully the devs take some ideas from this.^(1)

Goals:

1. Every combat situation has multiple ways it can go down besides one of the ships blows up.
2. Extended combat duration. The max possible DPS should take a minute minimum with constant firing to destroy the max possible EHP.
3. Jack of all Trades, Master of None for combat vessels.
4. Piracy: high risk, high reward.
5. Which weapons you have has more of an impact.

I'm going to try to keep the following from being too much of a wall of text, but a lot of this stuff is closely tied together^(2), so you'll have to bear with me.

&#x200B;

**Section 1\] Ship Health**

At this point I think everyone knows my views on armor gens and the flaws with them, so we'll skip that. Revert ship health to simply hull. Some changes: only walls, floors, and ceiling tiles provide the hull points, alternatively add heavier exterior blocks that provide hull points in addition to standard, lighter exterior blocks. Additionally, cap max hull. Something relatively high, \~1,000,000.

&#x200B;

**Section 2\] CPU**

CPU is a good tool to ensure that gunwalls aren't a thing, but we don't have to tie every system related to combat into it. By doing so you're reducing the likelihood of people using them in the first place since an extra gun is almost always going to be worth more. Limit hacking terminals to just one per ship. Same for the EMP. EMP can have a greater emphasis on being skill based, with a longer cool-down. Ammo loaders don't need to cost CPU at all. You can load them with an ACTR, and as far as I know the devs don't intend to change that. Even now I don't bother with more than a few ammo loaders if space is a concern since a cargo pad and an ACTR have a much better ammo:ship tile ratio.

&#x200B;

**Section 3\]** **Ship Speeds**

The low end of the IsR speed cap is 150 m/s. However, that's 335 MPH. For comparison, a Formula 1 car goes less than 250 MPH. Obviously space is much bigger and some people build ships big enough it takes time to fly from one end to the next. Still, it's a lot faster than it needs to be, you can cross the 2 km weapon range in 5 seconds; and the top speed disparity between 150 m/s and 500 m/s makes for certain aspects of combat balancing complicated.  Reduce max speed^(3) to 150 m/s, and turning is harder the faster your ship is moving, scaling up with the mass of your ship. Turn speed gains a mass cap like we have now for ship speeds.

&#x200B;

**Section 4\] Rock Paper Scissors**

By significantly reducing ship speeds, weapon range can have more of an impact, since you can't simply close the gap in a few seconds. Due to technical limitations of IsR, max possible range of any weapon is 4km, but that still leaves enough wiggle room for significant differences. Some other RPS balance options in IsR are things like RoF, accuracy, countermeasures (torpedoes could have significant range and damage compared to other weapons, but are vulnerable to being shot down or disrupted by an EMP burst), spool-up (railguns), travel time of the projectiles, extended cool-downs on ""super weapons"", and of course damage.

&#x200B;

**Section 5\] Specialization**

RPS balancing is hampered by weapon groups, since any benefits or negatives of choosing one weapon setup over another are non-existent when you can have 10 possible weapon arrangements. Limit ships to one weapon group. There is the option to adjust what weapons are active in a group in game already, so you wouldn't have to return to port to change armaments, but it shouldn't be fast enough to easily do so in combat.

&#x200B;

**Section 6\] Shields**

Shields should remain tied to the CPU system, but CPU cost could be reduced, and shields should have more flexibility. Add a slider to shield gens, one end marked regen rate, one end marked max capacity. Slider should be synced across all shield gens. If you expect to be dealing with high RoF weapons, increase regen rate. Someone's coming after you with a railgun alpha-strike ship, crank up the capacity. Once your shields hit 0, it takes considerably longer for them to come back online. (Devs are already planning that one.)  Ion ammo and ammunition that deals different damage to shields than hull add unneeded complexity IMO.

&#x200B;

**Section 7\] Hacking**

Hacking is an interesting tool for combat balancing, as everyone is ""equal"", assuming you limit everyone to one cyber terminal. Some improvements are needed however. Add a hacking screen in the cockpit so you don't need to dedicate a crew member to hacking to get any use out of it. Some skill aspect could also be added, like a simple [quick time event](https://youtu.be/_YQY-NYiM6c?t=5) that you can operate with just a single key. For the cards, instead of them being used as ammo for hacking, they could instead upgrade the terminal, increasing range, automatically preform the quicktime event when defending, increase max firewall health, reduce connection time, or reducing recovery time. You're limited to 8 slots with just one terminal, so you could potentially get quite creative with RPS balancing here as well.

&#x200B;

**Section 8\] Scanning, Visibility, and Stealth**

This is a mechanic that has always fascinated me because of the possibilities, and I really hope devs come back to the scanner mechanic in particular. Some ideas there: heat mechanic, when fully implemented, plays heavily into how you're detected at long ranges. Also could have active and passive scanners. Go active and you can more easily find and track other ships, but you turn into a light on a hill.

The cloak gen was frankly a massive letdown for me when it was released, as all the restrictions on it render it little more than a poor alternative to the station shield.

In my perfect world, cloak gen no longer has any affect at longer ranges, but it engages the ""deep cloak"" (clear shader) instantly. However, the cloak gen can only maintain a cloak for a limited amount of time, possibly dependent on the mass of the ship. Firing weapons no longer break cloak, but you could track the ship by looking at the weapon projectiles, looking for heat signatures, or large amounts of active scanning. Successfully hitting a cloaked ship would break it's cloak early.

&#x200B;

**Section 9\] Device Damage**

Like hacking, interior damage lends itself to being a balancing tool, but right now it has almost no impact on combat for a few reasons. Combat doesn't last long enough for the power loss from damaged devices to make an impact, many devices don't actually lose any functionality when damaged, and there's also the problem of how device damage is decided in the first place. Right now, interior devices take damage based on how close they are to the point of impact on the exterior. I believe it's a 3 meter sphere around the point of impact that determines what devices are damaged. This system does however mean you can prevent device damage entirely by surrounding your ship with exterior blocks more than 3m away from the actual interior of your ship.

I'm not sure what technical limitations are in place, but I'm going to presume that any system that can track the angle that a projectile hit at and create a straight line along which devices are damaged isn't possible. If it is possible, then please implement that. If it's not possible however, decide what devices are damaged are picked through RNG. For example, railguns deal high damage to only a few devices, while flak guns damage nearly every device onboard the ship but only a few points of damage each. Exterior devices could still be damaged based on proximity to impact.

&#x200B;

**Section 10\] Armor**

Since at this point almost all ship designs are going to have armor gens, and people have vaults full of nanobots, removing armor altogether is not really an option; and of course that would also be a fair amount of wasted modeling work. Some ideas for replacement uses for them:

* Armor gens provide additional hull points based on a percentage value of the ships default hull value. Shouldn't be extreme, dedicating 100% of your CPU to armor would get you max 50% bonus hull.
* Armor remains a separate value, and the amount of armor you have determines how much device damage you take. Certain weapon and ammunition types would deal armor damage in addition to standard damage, or possibly ignore armor altogether when dealing interior damage.

**Section 11\] Ship Repair and Support Devices**

Ship repair in IsR is something that doesn't really have too much impact because you can just salvage the ship, and there's also a significant amount of disparity between the various existing options for ship repair. Add some incentive to keep players from always salvaging their ship, and

This is an area that doesn't really have any existing systems in IsR, but I hope to see them eventually. This would be an area capital ships could excel at.  These would be ""weapons"" which cost CPU, but could beam extra power and shields to other ships, and repair hull and interior devices.

**Section 12\] Warping**

Remove warp disruption on hit. It's an overly complicated mechanic that the victim doesn't have any out of unless his ship is incredibly maneuverable. For T0 and T1 NPC enemies players are still going to be ""poor"" enough that forcing them to fight runs the high risk of costing them their ship which will most likely be all they have at that moment.

**Section 13\] Rifting**

Just a couple possibles solutions the issue of using rifting as an easy out to combat. First is, let us blow up rifts. If you shoot a rift, the damage (x2 or x3 since damage values are a little small compared to mass values) is subtracted from the mass of the rift. If that's not possible, apply the old warp disruption on hit mechanic to rifting, though maybe only when shields are down.",2019-02-22 01:15:08,2,0,-0.9972,-1,-1,1.0

Hello,

First off all, i'm pretty new to IR.
I think it would be a cool idea if you could build a ""battery station"". This station would be able tk create ""battery packs"". You can take the battery packs in your inventory, store them on cargo pads or place them in another battery station.
This would mean when creating a battery pack, you will take stored power from that power group or give the extra power to a powergroup.
To be able to add power to a battery station you need available space in batteries or powercells.

Do I have to set everything up in the Engineering Terminal itself or should it be pulling from the power grid I set up?

Okay,

I just got this game maybe a month or 2 ago, so far its amazing, its everything I have ever wanted in a space game besides the ability to land on planets. It feels like Pulsar Lost Colony, Space Engineers, and SpaceBase DF9. 

I love it, but it seems to me that there is a lack of further development. Did the company just drop this game? is it still getting content updates? I see so much potential yet a lack of new content and even more important, a lack of community and players. 

I would love to see this game blow up, I would love to wage into massive battles, or scavenge ships while trying to be careful not to run into hostile players, even better get stranded with out power and be rescued by friends.

The original Battlestar Galactica Cylon fighter ship is called a Cylon Raider. This certain version of a Sentinel Interceptor resembles a Cylon Raider, and is use as a general appearence reference. From my understanding, all Sentinels are Interceptors. I use only Sentinel to help keep the posting title shorter.

10456,InterstellarGarage,"Atlantid Multitool reveal method. Find all versions in any system.

When you find an Atlantid Monolith(AM) with an S-Class Multitool(MT), or one you like...

You have just landed at a AM, drop a save beacon on exit and create a Restore Point. Do this before you look at the AM. You will need to keep returning to this EXACT AM, so this Save Beacon is very important to keep the AM located. The pop-up podium off to the outer edge of the AM is where you obtain the MT, not the main part of AM.

First, Check the pop-up podium out for the MT(#1). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo. Reload the Restore Point at the AM, and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#2). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Next, enter your ship and fly to the nearest plantary body. Land, exit ship, reload that Restore Point. Fly back to the AM and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#3). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Continue to go to each other Planetary body. Land, exit your ship, reload that Restore Point created by exiting your ship. Returning each time to the original AM to check the new appearence. You can reveal them all for that sysem, or stop at your preference and claim it.

Typically, I go from closest to farthest Planetary body, moons included. MT versions are limited to the number of planetry bodies in the system, plus 1. There is a maximum of 7 versions for any system.  
  
If you did not get 2 versions at the AM upon finding it, usually means you skipped over the default MT. If you go to the Space station, and make a Restore Point, it should always give you the default MT appearance at the AM. I believe you can use your Capitol ship, or the Anomaly this way too.

Once you have revealed all the MT's in a system, you can always go backwards to any of the planetary bodies to create the Restore Point needed to claim that prefered MT at the AM.

A prerequisite mission is required before you can find Atlantid - [https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They\_Who\_Returned](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They_Who_Returned)

Good Hunting!

How to search a single planet for all the LS locations it can have.  


How to search a whole planet for the plethora of Living Ship(LS) locations each planet can have...LS locations are not limited like a solar systems max of 21 non-LS ships. A different LS will be at each different location you find.

Pre-search preparations:

* One Void egg per LS.
* 10000 nanites per LS.
* Must have completed the Starbirth mission.
* Make room for a new ship acquisition, or be prepared to exchange a ship you already have.
* Pick a planet you wish to search(""A planet"").
* Plot a course from A planet to the next closest planet or moon(""B planet""), and place your Capitol ship a few seconds beyond the halfway point between the two bodies.
* Place the Anomaly beyond your Capital ship another 10 -15 Pulsing seconds or so by plotting a course from your Capital ship near next to planet B, and away from other bodies in the system.
* Always make sure A planet is further away than B planet at each location.

\*\*Search begins:

Once you have completed the placements above, land on the A Planet. Hop out of your ship, making a save point. Place ONLY ONE Void egg(1) into your Exosuit inventory. KEEP ALL additional Void eggs in your Capital ship.

Get into your ship and take off from A planet. Pulse directly to your Capitol Ship. If the LS event occurs before you get close enough to your Capitol ship to begin the event, just reload your autosave and you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:"".

Remember that you have 20 seconds of Pulsing time where you can drag the event LS close enough to your Capital ship, before dropping out of pulse which starts the LS event.

If you cannot activate the event before you reach your Capitol ship, pulse to the Anomaly. Keep pulsing between your Capitol ship and Anomaly until you activate the event.

Once you have the new location, land near the new LS. Accept or reject the LS. If you reject the LS, you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:""

  
P.S. These Living Ship locations are all crash sites, and also have a normal spaceship. Turn off the Starbirth mission and reload your restore point, to view the normal type ship appearence.

Good Hunting!

The original Battlestar Galactica Cylon fighter ship is called a Cylon Raider. This certain version of a Sentinel Interceptor resembles a Cylon Raider, and is use as a general appearence reference. From my understanding, all Sentinels are Interceptors. I use only Sentinel to help keep the posting title shorter.

10980,InterstellarGarage,"Atlantid Multitool reveal method. Find all versions in any system.

When you find an Atlantid Monolith(AM) with an S-Class Multitool(MT), or one you like...

You have just landed at a AM, drop a save beacon on exit and create a Restore Point. Do this before you look at the AM. You will need to keep returning to this EXACT AM, so this Save Beacon is very important to keep the AM located. The pop-up podium off to the outer edge of the AM is where you obtain the MT, not the main part of AM.

First, Check the pop-up podium out for the MT(#1). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo. Reload the Restore Point at the AM, and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#2). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Next, enter your ship and fly to the nearest plantary body. Land, exit ship, reload that Restore Point. Fly back to the AM and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#3). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Continue to go to each other Planetary body. Land, exit your ship, reload that Restore Point created by exiting your ship. Returning each time to the original AM to check the new appearence. You can reveal them all for that sysem, or stop at your preference and claim it.

Typically, I go from closest to farthest Planetary body, moons included. MT versions are limited to the number of planetry bodies in the system, plus 1. There is a maximum of 7 versions for any system.  
  
If you did not get 2 versions at the AM upon finding it, usually means you skipped over the default MT. If you go to the Space station, and make a Restore Point, it should always give you the default MT appearance at the AM. I believe you can use your Capitol ship, or the Anomaly this way too.

Once you have revealed all the MT's in a system, you can always go backwards to any of the planetary bodies to create the Restore Point needed to claim that prefered MT at the AM.

A prerequisite mission is required before you can find Atlantid - [https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They\_Who\_Returned](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They_Who_Returned)

Good Hunting!

How to search a single planet for all the LS locations it can have.  


How to search a whole planet for the plethora of Living Ship(LS) locations each planet can have...LS locations are not limited like a solar systems max of 21 non-LS ships. A different LS will be at each different location you find.

Pre-search preparations:

* One Void egg per LS.
* 10000 nanites per LS.
* Must have completed the Starbirth mission.
* Make room for a new ship acquisition, or be prepared to exchange a ship you already have.
* Pick a planet you wish to search(""A planet"").
* Plot a course from A planet to the next closest planet or moon(""B planet""), and place your Capitol ship a few seconds beyond the halfway point between the two bodies.
* Place the Anomaly beyond your Capital ship another 10 -15 Pulsing seconds or so by plotting a course from your Capital ship near next to planet B, and away from other bodies in the system.
* Always make sure A planet is further away than B planet at each location.

\*\*Search begins:

Once you have completed the placements above, land on the A Planet. Hop out of your ship, making a save point. Place ONLY ONE Void egg(1) into your Exosuit inventory. KEEP ALL additional Void eggs in your Capital ship.

Get into your ship and take off from A planet. Pulse directly to your Capitol Ship. If the LS event occurs before you get close enough to your Capitol ship to begin the event, just reload your autosave and you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:"".

Remember that you have 20 seconds of Pulsing time where you can drag the event LS close enough to your Capital ship, before dropping out of pulse which starts the LS event.

If you cannot activate the event before you reach your Capitol ship, pulse to the Anomaly. Keep pulsing between your Capitol ship and Anomaly until you activate the event.

Once you have the new location, land near the new LS. Accept or reject the LS. If you reject the LS, you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:""

  
P.S. These Living Ship locations are all crash sites, and also have a normal spaceship. Turn off the Starbirth mission and reload your restore point, to view the normal type ship appearence.

Good Hunting!

11377,InterstellarGarage,"Atlantid Multitool reveal method. Find all versions in any system.

When you find an Atlantid Monolith(AM) with an S-Class Multitool(MT), or one you like...

You have just landed at a AM, drop a save beacon on exit and create a Restore Point. Do this before you look at the AM. You will need to keep returning to this EXACT AM, so this Save Beacon is very important to keep the AM located. The pop-up podium off to the outer edge of the AM is where you obtain the MT, not the main part of AM.

First, Check the pop-up podium out for the MT(#1). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo. Reload the Restore Point at the AM, and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#2). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Next, enter your ship and fly to the nearest plantary body. Land, exit ship, reload that Restore Point. Fly back to the AM and check for the MT. It should have changed in appearence(#3). Do not exchange unless you want it, exit covo.

Continue to go to each other Planetary body. Land, exit your ship, reload that Restore Point created by exiting your ship. Returning each time to the original AM to check the new appearence. You can reveal them all for that sysem, or stop at your preference and claim it.

Typically, I go from closest to farthest Planetary body, moons included. MT versions are limited to the number of planetry bodies in the system, plus 1. There is a maximum of 7 versions for any system.  
  
If you did not get 2 versions at the AM upon finding it, usually means you skipped over the default MT. If you go to the Space station, and make a Restore Point, it should always give you the default MT appearance at the AM. I believe you can use your Capitol ship, or the Anomaly this way too.

Once you have revealed all the MT's in a system, you can always go backwards to any of the planetary bodies to create the Restore Point needed to claim that prefered MT at the AM.

A prerequisite mission is required before you can find Atlantid - [https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They\_Who\_Returned](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/They_Who_Returned)

From my understanding, all Sentinels are Interceptors. I use only Sentinel to help keep the posting title shorter.

How to search a single planet for all the LS locations it can have.  


How to search a whole planet for the plethora of Living Ship(LS) locations each planet can have...LS locations are not limited like a solar systems max of 21 non-LS ships. A different LS will be at each different location you find.

Pre-search preparations:

* One Void egg per LS.
* 10000 nanites per LS.
* Must have completed the Starbirth mission.
* Make room for a new ship acquisition, or be prepared to exchange a ship you already have.
* Pick a planet you wish to search(""A planet"").
* Plot a course from A planet to the next closest planet or moon(""B planet""), and place your Capitol ship a few seconds beyond the halfway point between the two bodies.
* Place the Anomaly beyond your Capital ship another 10 -15 Pulsing seconds or so by plotting a course from your Capital ship near next to planet B, and away from other bodies in the system.
* Always make sure A planet is further away than B planet at each location.

\*\*Search begins:

Once you have completed the placements above, land on the A Planet. Hop out of your ship, making a save point. Place ONLY ONE Void egg(1) into your Exosuit inventory. KEEP ALL additional Void eggs in your Capital ship.

Get into your ship and take off from A planet. Pulse directly to your Capitol Ship. If the LS event occurs before you get close enough to your Capitol ship to begin the event, just reload your autosave and you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:"".

Remember that you have 20 seconds of Pulsing time where you can drag the event LS close enough to your Capital ship, before dropping out of pulse which starts the LS event.

If you cannot activate the event before you reach your Capitol ship, pulse to the Anomaly. Keep pulsing between your Capitol ship and Anomaly until you activate the event.

Once you have the new location, land near the new LS. Accept or reject the LS. If you reject the LS, you are back to ""\*\*Search begins:""

  
P.S. These Living Ship locations are all crash sites, and also have a normal spaceship. Turn off the Starbirth mission and reload your restore point, to view the normal type ship appearence.

Good Hunting!

This is a testimonial to confirm that I am a legitimate and returning customer of the Interstellar Blends \[Last order #68857 on 6/6/2024\] and have been taking them daily for the past four years.

Interstellar was introduced to me by my son, after I have been treating post op breast cancer in 2017/18 without any chemo, radiotherapy or hormone pills, and was researching and trying various natural alternatives, such as detox, fasting, change of diet, Rick Simpson Oil, essential oils, medicinal mushrooms, vitamins and supplements. I was making good progress, but with the blends, it took me to another level, both physically and mentally!!

Started with the full arsenal: 7 Sages, ACB, Senolitic, Luteolin, Autophagy, Peel, Spice, Glucose Blocker, Trinity, Autonomous, Victorious, Paraslayer, Shilajit and Matcha. Combined with regular intermittent fasting and mostly paleo diet, my health improved exponentially. I also felt much less anxious about the future, and Gavin‚Äôs expert advice, whenever I had a question, was really helpful.

Since then I also cycled various other blends: Nebula, Jing Force, Purge, Hypnotic, Anti-adipogenic, Thermo, Superhair, Plush, Rewire, Spaceborn and my health continued to improve. During that time I most incredibly managed to stop vaping Cannabis, which I had been using for stress and back pain and couldn‚Äôt imagine going without. Now I don‚Äôt miss it at all!

Most recently I added Titanium, Gainz, Sabretooth, Ocular, Anti-fatigue, NRF2 and GLP-1 activator in the mix, as I am getting older and accidentally broke my arm. My physiotherapist was seriously impressed with the speedy recovery, especially the fast return to my normal strength, even though I‚Äôm not very keen on the resistance or weights exercising. I prefer gardening and dogwalking.

On top of all these personal benefits, our 13y old Bulldog cross Staffie, who had two surgeries to remove mast cell tumours, at 10y & 12y, is now also on daily blends (ACB, Senolytic, Peel, Spice and Shilajit) and still going strong, running around the local parks and fields and enjoying life. Her new nickname is Indestructible.

In short, these blends helped me thrive following a cancer battle, effortlessly kick long term Cannabis addiction, vastly improve my mental health and heal a spiral fracture of the Humerus in record time. My son also benefited in numerous ways, the latest example being that he regrew part of his his gum with Sabretooth, but I will let him write his own review.

So I can attest that as a family, we are very real and regular customers of Interstellar! Coffee and blends in the morning has become a firm ritual to start of every day. At 55 I am much healthier and in better mental state than I was ten years ago. My next project is to utilise the blends to build muscle, increase fitness, immunity and brain power, to carry me strong and happy into the autumn of my life. Thanks Gavin for your amazing support!",2024-09-04 12:59:13,12,0,0.9917,1,1,1.0

Each product is thoughtfully crafted, and I appreciate the transparency regarding the ingredients and their benefits. It's clear that Gavin invests time and effort into ensuring his blends are not just effective but also safe and bioavailable.

One of the most impactful experiences has been the guidance Gavin provided to my dad after his recent heart attack. Understanding the critical importance of diet in recovery, LDL vs HDL, Gavin spent hours discussing tailored dietary changes and specific products that would support my dad's healing process. He not only recommended specific blends and amounts, but he recommended products such as a specific olive oil from another company. His recommendations have made a significant difference, providing my father with the tools he needs to reclaim his health, vitality and stay off dangerous drugs such as Statins.

Three Months In ‚Äì Real Results, No BS

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends for three months, and the results are legit.

Started with Rewire and immediately felt the brain kick. After I gave Gavin a full breakdown of what I was dealing with, he put together a personalized stack. I ended up going with the $777 package, which came with 18 blends total. He even threw in a couple extras. Texting with him is quick and direct‚Äîsuper helpful.

Favorites so far:
	‚Ä¢	Thunder ‚Äì hits even at half dose
	‚Ä¢	Nebula ‚Äì clean, sustained energy
	‚Ä¢	Ascendance ‚Äì crushing 20 years of chronic pain
	‚Ä¢	HELICOBACTER ‚Äì completely ended my nightly heartburn, got me back to mouth taping after 3 months off
	‚Ä¢	Purge ‚Äì steady, no-pressure weight loss over the last few months

His pine pollen is top-tier. I tried a replacement off Amazon‚Äîtasted like cardboard. Got a refund and went back to the real deal.

Biggest shift: I‚Äôve decided to come off TRT after a year. These blends gave me the confidence and physical support to make that call.

11903,Interstellar_Blends,"Adhd Destroyed Full Focus & Clarity With  Interstellar plan!

I recently experienced an incredible journey with Autonomous Rewire and Trinity, paired with deep meditation. I believe I reached the ultimate state of zen. During this process, I felt as though I was in a deep sleep and even achieved astral projection. I vividly saw myself sleeping, with my hands glowing in vibrant, multicolored transparency. I floated around my house and even observed my dad sleeping. It was an awesome experience‚Äîuntil I encountered some things I wasn't quite prepared for during my second attempt.

  


In previous discussions with my group, we explored these topics extensively, and I want to emphasize the importance of being spiritually ready for such experiences. I am truly grateful for Gavin's work; he is incredibly dedicated and outworks everyone out there. After just two days of using Autonomous, I feel like I've returned to 100% hustle‚Äîmy focus and motivation are at an all-time high.

  


Autonomous has been a game-changer for managing my ADHD; nothing else has worked as effectively for me. However, I urge everyone to know their limits when it comes to practices like astral projection and lucid dreaming.¬†

  


Overall, I highly recommend Autonomous for anyone seeking to enhance their mental clarity and spiritual growth. Thank you, Gavin, for your amazing work!""

11904,Interstellar_Blends,"Gavin changed my life. 25 BLEND MEGA COMBO !!!!

What‚Äôs up, everybody! I just had to share my immense gratitude and the life-changing experience I‚Äôve had with Gavin‚Äôs creation Interstellar Blends.

My name is Francis, I‚Äôm 28, and I‚Äôm from Quebec, Canada. To give you some context, I‚Äôm workin four jobs, 3 are extremely physical, and the 4th is trading which demand alot of mental power and focus. In the summer, I work 16 to 18 hours a day, sometimes even more. It‚Äôs absolutely draining.

By the end of 2023, my body and mind hit a breaking point. The nonstop grind caught up.. I hit a wall make of fuc‚Ä¶. titanium‚Ä¶ My whole system was shutdown, It got me crazy health issues.. I was dealing out of nowhere with fungal infections, constant headaches, autoimmune flare-ups, MCAS, and a completely wrecked nervous system. My nervous system was so shut, I was shaking when standing up, my whole mind was in the dark,, depressive spiral, and I started having thoughts I‚Äôd never wish on anyone, it was HELL‚Ä¶.

That‚Äôs when, by the grace of God, Gavin announced a challenge to win a 25 Blend Mega Combo and guess what? My friend and I WON! This was a blessing because I had no idea how to recover from this hole I was in..

When the package arrived, it was game on! I immediately started fasting with the blends and water for six days to start my recovery ASAP. Normally fasting for me is kinda Hard and by day 2 Im half dead in my bed wondering why the F I started a fast LOL , I‚Äôd be drained, barely functioning. but with the blends is another dimension literally..! It didnt felt like a was fasting AT ALL.

By the 2rd day, I was sleeping like a Rock which I wasnt able to do for at least 1y, and waking up feeling like a whole new person. I couldn‚Äôt believe how effortless fasting felt. For anyone who struggles with fasting, seriously, reach out to Gavin. Just follow the steps Gavin gives you, and you‚Äôll be golden Fast!

After the 6 day fast, I broke the fast with some worries because I have bad experience of refeeding in the past. Ive put the worries aside and broke the fast the best I could, and‚Ä¶. Not a SINGLE issues! No histamine flares up, no pain, nothing!. This blew my mind because I‚Äôve had severe digestive problems since I was 5yo, like MCAS, SIBO, SIFO, and mold toxicity. In the past, fasting always came with nasty, crazy symptoms, especially during refeeding. But with the blends, I bounced back like I never though possible. TONS of energy, laser focus for trading and vitality was through the roof.

I‚Äôve done ALOT lab testing the past 5years to track pathogens, deficiencies, and other health issues. After just one month on the blends, I did the same lab test and 80% of the issues, pathogen and defiencies were completely rGONE . In one freaking month.. It still doesnt make sense to me LOLL Good luck finding a doctor that will do that for you‚Ä¶

On top of that, my hair is growing back after starting to bald at 23! Super Tonic Hair for the win! Talking about Wins.. LOL If you ever had ED type of issues‚Ä¶. Thunder is quite insane and effective‚Ä¶ I will no into details but It was life changing for multiple person AHAH

If you have digestive issues you HAVE to take the Stomach Reset Combo. The first 3 day with the Purge can be a mess, It was for me. But after the big clean up, it feels like you are flying, heaviness is lifted from your soul!

I cant thank Gavin enough for this incredible opportunity. The timing was divine and it saved my life. I wasnt sure how I‚Äôd pull myself out of this mess I was in , but with God‚Äôs grace, I took the chance and it was worth it 10000%

Now, still thriving! I gave some of the blends to close familly member espacially Victorious when they got Cov. Victo with Peels and Spice Got Cov down in 2 days ! This is revolutionary lol.

I have taken many other Interstellar Blends over the years and have had excellent results from every one (Trinity, Rewire, Nebula and Spaceborn being some of my most favorites). I just started Ecstatic a few days ago and let me say this blend lives up to its name! 


Ecstatic Effects: How It Feels

The effects are almost immediate: a sense of calm and what I would actually describe as ""bliss"" washes over your mind and body. The feeling of not needing or wanting anything, because for once, you just feel satisfied is incredible. If you're used to your mind constantly racing-- get ready for silence! This blend is literally a game-changer if you have trouble meditating or focusing. 

If you are suffering from anxiety,  depression,  stress or even just trying to change your mindset and be more positive,  try Ecstatic. I haven't experienced any negative side effects from it, I doubt you can say that about any prescription medication for treating anxiety and depression! 

I highly recommend Ecstatic and all of Interstellar Blends products. I wasn't paid for this review,  it is my honest experience, and I hope this helps someone üôè ",2024-10-23 19:40:20,9,0,0.9875,1,1,1.0
11907,Interstellar_Blends,"Winning Ecstatically 

If you‚Äôre serious about fasting and want to take your wellness journey to the next level, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is your ultimate ally. As someone who has embraced fasting as a core part of my health regimen, I can confidently say this blend has been instrumental in supporting my longest fast to date‚Äî6 full days!

What sets this blend apart is how it provides sustained energy and stamina, even during extended periods without food. Normally, by day three or four, fatigue starts to creep in, making it challenging to stay focused and energized. But with ECSTATIC, I felt a clear, steady flow of energy that kept me going, never feeling like I was about to hit a wall or collapse from exhaustion.

This blend not only fuels my body but also sharpens my mental clarity, allowing me to maintain productivity and focus throughout my fast. I found myself thinking clearer, feeling more present, and even having an enhanced sense of wellbeing, all without the usual brain fog that accompanies prolonged fasting.

For anyone looking to explore the transformative power of extended fasting while maintaining optimal energy levels and mental acuity, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is the key. It‚Äôs more than just a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolutionary tool for anyone looking to push their limits and achieve a new state of wellness.

I've been taking Interstellar Blends for several years now. My absolute must-haves are peel, spice and victorious. When I get the sniffles, half a teaspoon of victorious + 1/4 teaspoon of the others knocks it right out. I also love the beauty blend, and I notice a definite difference in my skin when I use it regularly.  But my biggest testament to Interstellar blends is for the use of hypertension.  I was diagnosed with hypertension after childbirth. I went to doctor after doctor and none could figure it out. In the years post-partum, I exercised regularly, fasted, walked miles per day and still had hypertension. ""Well, some people just have this problem and we don't know why. Take these pills"". So, I took the pills and they kept adding different pills and changing dosages and it didn't get better. I was young enough that I couldn't accept that this would be my life. So I reached out to Gavin and he recommended apigenin, aldosterone down-regulator, jing force and pulsar. I used them and reversed my hypertension in a few months.

11911,Interstellar_Blends,"Take Gainz with you everywhere!


I recently spent six months traveling across various countries, and one of the best decisions I made was to bring along Interstellar Blends' Gainz blend. Long-term travel can be incredibly taxing on both body and mind‚Äîirregular sleep, constant changes in time zones, and unpredictable diets can all add up to leave you feeling worn out. Luckily, Gainz came to my rescue.

Right from the start, Gainz was an absolute game-changer. I felt an impressive boost in  physical energy. I was amazed at how well I could bounce back the next day. 

The most remarkable thing about Gainz was its impact on muscle recovery and overall stamina. As someone who tries to stay fit even on the road, it‚Äôs usually tough to maintain consistency with workouts while traveling, but Gainz made it much easier. My muscle soreness was significantly reduced, and my energy levels remained steady, which kept me motivated to get those quick workouts in whenever I had the chance.

Overall, I can‚Äôt recommend Interstellar Blends and Gainz enough, especially for those on the move or looking for an edge in their physical performance and recovery. It's not just a supplement‚Äîit's been an essential part of maintaining my health, fitness, and well-being throughout my travels.

11914,Interstellar_Blends,"Ecstatic is AMAZING!!! üòç

For the past five days, I've been taking four scoops of Trinity, two scoops of Ecstatic, and two scoops of Ascendance in a cup of black coffee. For reference, each scoop is equivalent to 1/8 of a teaspoon. 

Apart from this, I've been consuming nothing else for the rest of the day, except for a sip of water when my mouth feels dry. I wanted to see what Ecstatic can do on its own, and I added Trinity and Ascendance because I've been doing a lot of moving this week and I'm on my menstrual cycle.

The results have been significant. I now easily eat just once a day. In fact, I actually have to remind myself to eat, and I'm not really hungry. I just feel like I should eat something nutritious. This is a huge change for me because I usually want (and eat) any and everything during my menstrual cycle. 

It's a strange feeling to not be thinking about eating food all day. This is doubly significant because I'm visiting my hometown, Chicago, right now and I was worried about how I was going to manage because of all the incredible food here that's comforting to me. But I haven't even wanted anything in the four days I've been here, thanks to Ecstatic.

I almost forgot to mention that I drove from Houston to Chicago straight through. It was an 18-hour drive with no food (just the blends I mentioned earlier) and a little tiredness. The last time I did this trip, I had to stop overnight and sleep. Not this time.

Initially, my experience was frustrating and debilitating, as I frequently battled upper respiratory infections and bronchitis, often accompanied by a relentless cough. While my doctor prescribed Claritin D and regular Claritin, I quickly became dependent on these medications just to feel somewhat functional. 

After several years of this struggle, I began to notice some unwanted side effects from daily use, particularly persistent constipation. Despite trying teas and other remedies, nothing seemed to provide the relief I desperately needed‚Äîuntil about a year ago, when a friend introduced me to the Purge herb from Interstellar Herbs. This particular herb worked wonders for me, sparking my curiosity to explore their other offerings. I decided to try the Spice and Peel herbs for my allergies. I will admit, there was some hesitation on my part; I had grown so reliant on Claritin D that I was apprehensive about going a day without it. I even contemplated my doctor‚Äôs advice to undergo testing, but it required me to be off the medication for at least a week.

When I finally mustered the courage to take the leap, I was astonished. That very first night, I was free of congestion, and the next morning, I could finally breathe through both nostrils‚Äîsomething that had become a rarity for me. It was a moment of realization; I had become addicted to pseudoephedrine, a substance commonly used in the creation of meth. My last order (#67603) in June 2024 included these two amazing herbs, and I can't express how grateful I am that they worked. These herbs are truly life-changing for me, and I wholeheartedly recommend Interstellar Herbs to everyone struggling with similar issues. If you're searching for natural, effective relief from allergies, look no further than Interstellar Herbs!

I've loved my experience with these blends over the last 3 years. I originally purchased to support my body for weight loss but also tried others that have been amazing for mental clarity and focus.

I started using the blends a few years ago but fell off the wagon and after I gained so much weight and my knees were hurting so much because of the extra weight that I could barely go up and down the stairs when I decided this is not life so I decided to take the bull by the horns and get control of my life so my last order was for the challenge combo order # 70123 from August 12 2024.  
  
I can honestly testify that in a few weeks has changed my life. I have lost 4 lbs. and now it is not so painful to go up and down the stairs since I live on the 3rd floor, my energy has improved as well as my focus. I am able to fast from 7pm to noon the following day with no issues and this was something I never thought possible since I was a junk food lover ¬†and being Latin American where all we eat is carbs has not made it easy. I plan to stick to this protocol ¬†and get the weight and my health to where it should be. I have two young kids and need all the energy I can get.¬†

The blend will make miracles but you need to be willing to put some work like walking and eating healthy to help you lose weight faster and stopped being a couch potato.

I am a real customer. My last order number is #66268 on May 12, 2024. 

My favorite blends are Autonomous and Rewire, which guarantee incredible relief from stress, if you are someone who has a lot of stress during the day, these 2 blends will help you a lot. Another favorite blend is Purge, if you want to feel like a new person, this blend is something incredible and indescribable. (you really feel better after it!!!)

If you want to feel unstoppable and have an incredible amount of energy, then Supernova or Nebula is what will help you tremendously.

If you think that blends are expensive, think about how much you spend per month on alcohol, drugs or junk food and then you will realize that they are not expensive at all and last a really long time. 

I recommend them to everyone who wants to take their health to the next level.  Thank you Interstellar!

So, came across this site along my journey, and was recommended to check out the blends. This was exactly what I was searching for. Herbal blends to aid my daily life (exercising, dieting, meditating, etc, etc), as I believe unfortunately we are unable to get all the goodness from foods alone in this day in age.

¬†I am a real person, not an AI bot or similar, I am not perfect, and do go through my fair share of struggles. This is a true review and testimonial.

¬†I have ordered a few times but one of my last orders was in April 2024 - #63876. I stocked up for the year. The blends are mixed with my morning coffee, and not only does the caffeine wake me up, but the herbal blends also fire up the correct receptors and I have no brain fog at all. I am able to focus in and get on with my day at work, no stopping fir umming and rrring, I am straight there and straight up with the answers. My brain loves the stuff.

¬†Not only for my brain but also for my body, my body feels good and can feel my digestion is a lot better. Once the digestion was sorted it helped me in other areas of my life. I am not as tired during the day, no more afternoon naps. I also have enough energy to hit the gym in a fasted state.

¬†All my blends are consumed in the morning whilst in a fasted state and I take with coffee. You can take it with matcha tea as well if you like.

¬†On another note, I also tried a newer blend ""Rewire"". I ordered this initially to aid me wean of certain substances which I should not have been taking. Not only did it help with my cravings, I felt it also helped me sleep at night (which was always an issue in the past when trying to quit). I finished the pack and never felt better. I wish I found these blends a decade ago.

¬†I highly recommend trying some of the blends, have a look on the website, there will something for everyone. We do not get the nutrients in the foods as we did 50 years ago, and with ultra processed foods which has swamped our markets everything little bit helps, and we should all find something to aid our daily living, along with the right diet and exercise.

¬†Give these guys a go, you won't regret it. I have ordered several times and will continue to order into my old age.",2024-08-28 09:27:11,19,0,0.9901,1,1,1.0

Since my first order in June 2022, my life has been transformed in amazing ways. I‚Äôm grateful for all the reviews and testimonials, and now it‚Äôs time for me to add my 2 cents! I still remember the excitement of getting home from work, seeing my package had arrived, and not being able to wait until morning. I made a hot cacao with Rewire and Supernova and instantly felt the shift‚ÄîI ended up cleaning my entire room that evening. It felt like an internal rearrangement manifesting outward‚Äîa literal rewiring.  
  
Over the past 2 years, I‚Äôve used a variety of combos with fasting and lost all the weight and emotional baggage from the lockdowns. My most recent order (#67537) on June 7th, 2024, included 7 Sages, Autonomous, Nebula, and a Fertility sample. I go through Autonomous much quicker, so I‚Äôll be ordering double next time. Autonomous is my absolute favorite blend, with Nebula a close second for boosting my willpower. Health is a holistic journey, and these blends are a powerful tool in conjunction with diet, fasting, meditation, exercise etc. for becoming SUPERHUMAN!  
  
As a woman who goes through cycles, the Fertility blend is my favorite for nurturing my YIN and managing my cycles with ease and grace. I‚Äôve only tried one sample so far but will order more. Alongside Autonomous and Fertility, 7 Sages is becoming a new favorite, offering variety and activating different areas each day. I‚Äôve been ordering blends consistently for two years, and they‚Äôve become an integral part of my lifestyle. Along with the other modalities mentioned, I am consistently leveling up. I‚Äôve moved through four jobs, each better than the last, and finally landed my dream job, where I feel content for the long term. The drive and brainstorming wouldn‚Äôt have been as powerful without these blends. My aura is brighter, and I radiate abundance and strength. Just like water seeks its own level, keep doing the work and everything evens out.  
  
Gavin is a force to be reckoned with. Achieving something that truly benefits society is no easy task. The research and willpower he and his team have put into their craft, managing thousands of customers with impeccable professionalism, is inspiring.

11930,Interstellar_Blends,"I wanted to repost my review from trustpilot because I spent quite some time writing it, and I want it to be here as well: The Truth about Interstellar Blends and Gavin (personal experience)

I have been on this journey with Gavin since 2020 and his blends absolutely changed my life.



I found him through the trading community where some buddies of mine recommended me his Trinity and Nebula for trading. And boy did it make a difference.



I wanted my parents to get me some of his blends, and upon inspection that my father did, he said that Gavin must be a scammer for there is no such thing as perfect reviews. So they didn't buy the blends for me. 



But I trusted my trading buddies and wanted to at least give the man a shot to see if it makes a difference. 



I had to save up for a few months to get that $600 extra cash for 2 big bags of blends. And I was praying that it will work since it was hard back then for me to get my hands on that much money. 



After the two bags of Nebula and Trinity arrived, in 3 days of fasting + blends genuinely eliminated my anxiety, depression and tension, and completely restructured my presence. I had severe ADHD and 1/4 of tsp of Trinity and Nebula made me present, here and now.



3 months later I had my first profitable trading month in Forex.



NOTE: its not the blends that make you successful, but they are the key to easier achievement.



I could never trade and study 16h per day everyday for 3 months and put in the work without the blends. 



And if you think that is amazing, it was just the beginning. After hitting my first 10k month at age of 19, I got myself a shit ton of blends, and later down the line when his list of blends expanded, I am buying minimum of 15 different blends every single time...



Not only that, but I also had epilepsy, and I started to reject the poisonous pills that doctors gave me which had literally infinite negatives and only one potential positive.



With Alz, Lutein, Apigenin I have not had any more seizures, tho I believe there is more to it than blends. Gavin also got me on ketogenic diet, 22/2 fasting, one 3 day dry fast per quarter and one 3 day dry + 3 day water per year. 



I have studied epilepsy and seizures and made a huge leap for myself, 6 years seizure free and got my drivers license now. Thanks to blends, diet, lifestyle changes and mindset - I also helped a few others do the same... 



In the other review I forgot to mention that I am adrenaline addict and I do a lot of extreme sports. Nebula, Autonomous, Trinity, Rewire and Anti-Fatigue have helped me push the limits of the sports I am in, and I also gave the blends to my friends who went nuts for them. 



The blends work like a charm. But they are not magic. If you think you can drink alcohol, eat junk food, watch adult content and scroll social media and have the blends cope for all the negatives, you are mistaken. Blends are enhancers, boosters, rewards for correct behavior, not magic pill. Do your part and the blends will do theirs.



Needless to say Gavin's Interstellar Blends are a big part of my life for the past 4 years, and will continue to be.



For anyone thinking that his products are too expensive I say: Find me someone who offers even remotely close products and also ask yourself, how bad is your mindset that you are putting a price on your well-being and health....



If anyone has any doubts about what I wrote reach out to me, if you have any questions reach out, anything at all, just reach out, I am willing to help and give you a live testimony with more depth and more instructions. (Telegram, twitter, instagram, whatever, look up my name or handle u/giustix369, will vouch for Gavin any day!)



I already went on for too long, but you would as well if something literally changed your life and you see people hating on the guy that is helping thousands become self-actualized. Gavin answers questions, helps you out in DM's if you just ask. 



But yes it is true, HE WILL NOT TOLLERATE WEAK EXCUSE MAKING PEOPLE. 



Here in the Interstellar Blends community we strive to be excellent, to make the best version of ourselves and not compromise with anything. We break limits, we move mountains and we work together. 



Super community, super Gavin, super us!

Since I started drinking these incredible blends my memory is much better, my addiction to food is at its lowest ever, even when I have a ""cheat"" day and dont fast, I can eat breakfast at 8am and then eat my next meal at 3pm, that has never happened before, I always snacked. I can control my appetite like a boss! Always had an addiction to sweets but now sometimes in the evening I say to myself ""hmm, I didnt had anything sweet today, wtf"" and Im thankful to the blends for that, and yes you need to have some willpower and not be a pu$$ to start but once you get angry with yourself and set realistic, small-to-start-with goals, you will do it with ease.

Now my girlfriend is happy that I remember small things she tells me, I feel much better overall cause I don't always digest and have unlimited energy, Im way stronger in the gym (gainz) people tell me Im on steroids which I think is a joke but I take the complement haha, my brain works at 120%, much more organised and collected, I don't get stressed that much running my business and I got time to think and do other things other than previously making myself too much food, eat it and then feel bloated and sh1t for the rest of the day.

Five years ago, I happened upon Interstellar Blends when it was tagged in a social media post about a coffee replacement that promised improved energy and focus. The response to the tag said something to the effect of the coffee alternative not even coming close to what Interstellar Blends provided, so I was instantly intrigued. The Interstellar Blends website was full of legitimate, science-backed, evidenced-based research supporting not only each blend,  but each and every blend‚Äôs ingredients. After basically a lifetime of searching for something that would help with repeated failed weight loss attempts and also wanting an escape from increasing depression, anxiety, and brain fog, I jumped into a 12 day challenge, lost 36 pounds, and never felt better physically, mentally, and emotionally.

I started dryfasting 2018 when I heard of it from the snake diet guy, later on I discovered the page dryfasting.com which lead me even deeper into the journey and provided very elaborate and scientifically backed information about dry fasting and it is when I first read about how herbal blends can support fasting and be combined with drytasting, where the effects of herbs are potentiated after dryfasts and they make fasting easier especially for overweight people.
After buying my first blends I could feel some distinct effects like restructuring in my spine, more energy, that I never felt from herbs like that before. I bought many herbal products, but these blends gave me the best results. I would say they are really close to giving you the maximum benefit you can reap from herbal products.
Later on I stumbled over the masterfastsystem, which gave me great relieve of symptoms and progress on my health journey in many ways and it helped me pull out a lot of mucoid plaque and all kinds of other nasty things, but since I have quite low bodyfat the masterfastsystem wasn't always suitable for me anymore because it pulled too much on my reserves over the years. Moreover I have concerns that it could age you too quickly, but it really helps me a lot if I do it sporadically.

So then I decided to buy a big stock of interstellarblends for the first time in 2022 to support me with fasting because I was sure I could trust that they give me a great effect. Without these blends I couldn't have done the first semester of my masters study (due to my health), I can feel them helping me in many ways, my collarbone, spine and skeleton shifted, my seasonal allergies improved, I could tolerate coffee with them again (I stopped drinking it though, cause I have nervous issues and I'm sensitive to them, they really help me to function in everyday life, I can feel my nervous system symptoms less (I have multiple sclerosis) even though I still am in a battle with my health issues, which is a great gift to me and is the reason why I became obsessed with the blends and would recommend them to all people who want to perform better, fast easier, live longer, but mainly to the sick people to make your everyday life quite a bit easier.

My goal now is to work myself up to longer dryfasts without depleting myself too much of nutrients. So the plan is that I try to get to the 3 day dryfasting mark (which is hard for me cause I'm an ectomorph, plus with certain health problems it can be harder) again as I have done in the past and in between refuel with healthy food and take the blends (which then are more effective after a longer dryfast) and then maybe after 2-3 weeks try my next long dryfast. I hope I can heal further by following this plan.",2024-08-02 10:28:19,18,0,0.9975,1,1,1.0

**Trinity** is the singular blend has fixed more issues for more people than I can count. The FB posts about this blend from people are just incredible! If you have a health or body/mind issue, then it‚Äôs very likely that this blend will drastically improve it. If you‚Äôre unsure, then send a message and ask! They‚Äôre very responsive and take customer service seriously.  
This is the highest quality most comprehensive herbal blend on the planet (except for Seven Sages which is still in beta). If you try just one blend this is the one to start with!  
No matter how bad a bad day is, it turns into a good day with Trinity. Just 1/8 to 1/4 tsp a day is plenty for most. Helps me to feel calm, clear, buoyant, naturally joyful and light, helps remove those feelings of depression, doom and gloom, where the world is caving in on you.  
Tired of life? Every day pretty much sucks? Can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt focus, tired all the time, can‚Äôt do family time at home or perform on the job anymore? Just wanna get away from everybody and be alone so you can sulk and eat ice cream and watch movies? Then get Trinity and feel joyful and young again! I take Trinity with Thermogenesis everyday, and add Pine Pollen with Supernova or the Original Blend on those days when I really need to rock and roll. Face wrinkles and skin issues are lessening. I look younger and have that inner glow again. No more sallow, tired, wrinkled, energyless, lifeless, deadbeat zombie face anymore. How many people out there look like zombies to you? Like they would rather curl up and die than live? Half if not most? Are you one of them? Tired of it? Then invest in yourself and buy these blends and get the show on the road! These herbal blends combined with 22/2 or 21/3 intermittent fasting are the most valuable life and health improvement tools I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôve been taking these blends for over a year and doing intermittent fasting for a month and it‚Äôs the best health change I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs anti-cancer too! So stop dilly dallying and just do it! (I‚Äôm not a salesmen and have never made a dime from these blends, and don‚Äôt want to!)

     I have tried many Interstellar Blends for mind and body. For the mind I have tried Nebula, Rewire, Trinity & Apigenin. For the body I have tried Plush & Super Tonic Hair. While all of these blends work great and have served their purpose I have found the most benefit from Autonomous & Heavy Metal Detox. 
     I have been diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage years & was never a fan of stimulant medication. Not only does it make me feel anxious but it also dampens my creativity. I work in the sound and music industry so taking my stimulant medication has a negative effect on my work. Autonomous has helped me have the initiative I need to start & finish my work while also maintaining my natural creativity. 
     I have had deep lines under my eyes & on my hands since childhood. I did more research & learned that this could be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. I decided to try the Heavy Metal Detox formula & it was definitely the answer to my problem. I feel like I have aged backwards! My hands look a lot healthier & the deep lines under my eyes have become more refined. I hope more people will try the Heavy Metal Detox formula as many Americans are exposed to heavy metals on a daily basis. 
     I would also like to shout out Rewire for helping me to reach six months of sobriety! Plush also makes my skin beautiful but I am pretty young & I don‚Äôt think this formula is necessary as I am currently on a budget.

Now, it feels almost effortless. The blends keep me feeling satisfied and energized throughout my fasting periods, making the process so much easier. It's not just about curbing hunger, it's about feeling genuinely good while doing it.  
  
I also feel sharper and more focused. My overall well-being has improved, and I attribute a significant part of that to Interstellar Blends. If you're looking for a natural, effective way to enhance your health and wellness journey, I can't recommend Interstellar Blends enough.",2024-07-28 23:29:40,30,0,0.9848,1,1,1.0

Started giving the blends to my sister who was experiencing severe depression last summer.  After taking rewire and spaceborn consistently, she ended up going to her first boxing class. Keep in mind, she had not been to the gym since this past January. Also, the boxing class I go to isn‚Äôt the easiest. It was very relieving to see her take this pathway, and notice improvement in her life. 

For me - I am a survivor of SA and this has opened up a lot of dark gateways in my life previously (toxic relationships, heavy drinking and smoking from 13-29 years old, etc etc etc) after a lot of self analysis - Got the sign to give up the numbing factors in my life at 29.  I am now 36 - and was mysteriously guided to the blends in 2022. My favorite blends where I noticed a pretty deep shift: Nebula, Spaceborn, Rewire, and Autonomous 

As a result of taking Nebula specifically -  I feel I was able to get a new lease on life again. Was interviewing for remote sales positions and landed within the first week. Learning and growing a lot on this journey  and feeling like I‚Äôm shifting into a new time line. Feeling a lot more relaxed in my body. It‚Äôs been a process but I am happy to be in a community that understands. Although it‚Äôs been a rocky past, the entrepreneurial, trading and sales realm seems to have embraced me with open arms. The ability to help heal my brain and body through the blends and fasting has been crucial towards my healing in all avenues of my life. ",2024-07-28 23:53:50,27,0,0.9684,1,1,1.0

I am a real customer who has used these blends since 2015. My first was the original blend that Gavin developed. Over the years I have tried many and my personal favorite is Trinity. I love how balanced it makes me feel. A little under 2 years ago I was in an automobile accident and fractured my left clavicle and ankle. I immediately ordered and started using Titanium to support bone healing. I also experienced weight loss specifically muscle loss after the accident and have been using and loving Gainz. Before Gainz I was at 117# I could not gain weight (My ideal weight is 127-130#) It took a while and today I weight in at 127 and I have developed muscle strength again. 2 more wins came from Ocular, my vision has improved since using it and Sabre Tooth. Last dental cleaning was the best in a long time! I am about to place a new order as I am running low. Because I believe in these blends I have referred many friends and coaching clients to Gavin and his team. It feels so good to be able to suggest a solution to concerns they have that I know will benefit them. The Interstellar team is always available to provide guidance and recommendations.

I was introduced to these blends by my son two years ago. Our family was going through a health bout with mold toxicity. I have tried so many of the blends over the last two years and I can say they have really brought back my health to where it was. I was in a pretty weak state physically as were my kiddos. Fast forward two years later and I‚Äôm back to my job as a personal trainer feeling great! Gavin is great! He is quick to respond when I asked all kinds of questions about what blends would help us with our health issues and we had many symptoms. There are so many blending I continue to take daily and if I were to say a few that I absolutely love it would be gainz because I‚Äôm on my feet all day working working out with my clients. It helps me maintain my strength and stamina. I also really like Trinity. It gives me that peaceful feeling and keeps me calm and clear all day.

I amca real customer and this is my honest review of the product. I have been a customer for 5 years now. I originally started taking peel for reducing anxiety and night terrors. It worked for a couple of years. Now that I have been taking it longer, I'm noticing different things. 

People around me get sick, I am celiac and have a low immune system but I have not been getting sick even when around others that are. I fully contribute it to peel. 

I think that the trinity also works well for anxiety. My only downfall is that it tastes really really bad and I can't just take it with water like I can with the peel.

Trinity is always my go to... gives the ultimate emotional stability. Emotional stability = financial stability. No clouded vision affecting your judgements. Allows you to see things for what they are, and take action on the neccesary steps in order to get what you want /make your dreams come true. No more anger, frustration, axiety, or irritibility.  Trinity is like the foundation in my opinion. I work in sales so its vital you dont allow emotions to affect your presentations. Allows you to freely express gratitude and let the universe do its thing in rewarding your gratefulness. Truly thankful for Gavins blends. It the real deal.

Honestly my review for this blend kinda writes itself! I had been on Plush loading dose for only 9 days when I walked in to see my hair stylist and she immediately noticed that my skin was glowing -- even though I had a mask on, haha. She immediately asked me what I was doing and I knew it was the work of this magical blend. I had definitely begun to notice some subtle differences myself, but getting that validation from someone else who had no idea about it and so early on in the process was mindblowing.

Plush has a way of brightening and smoothing your complexion in a way that's hard to describe until you experience it. You can also tell a difference in skin texture after being on it for the loading dose period, and it usually doesn't take the full 2-3 weeks to start seeing noticeable results. 

I am 34 and have never done any cosmetic surgeries, injectables, etc. -- it's really important to me to maintain my beauty from a holistic and natural place. I'm already several years into an organic/biodynamic skincare regimen, so it has been exciting to find an herbal supplement that I can compliment that with to work on my beauty from the inside.

When the world shut down with ‚ÄúCovid-19‚Äù the world felt dark, I began studies with the forex industry, and found These Life changing Blends through a popular trader.

He literally answers everyone and wants to see the best in them. I Started my journey with Trinity #1 blend. 
 I just kept it going after, anything negative I always looked for an optimistic path. Spiritually helped a lot with reprogramming my mind for the better not a sheep to society. I explored into other blends such as (Seven Sages, Nebula, Autonomous, Pine Pollen, Shilajit) these combos excelled me to new levels in life and everyone around you will notice your aura spilling out GREATNESS!

BLACK EDITION ‚ú®üêâ‚ú®

‚ÄúWe all choose our own paths in life.  So many life lessons to be learned and some of us for whatever reason choose to learn the hard way.  I‚Äôd rather learn as much as possible from other‚Äôs mistakes rather than my own, doing my best to make the right informed decisions.  It makes it easier to have positive role models to follow and learn how to do things the right way!  I want to thank Gavin for being that for me.  I‚Äôm continually blown away at his high degree of service and integrity.  There‚Äôs countless blessings to be grateful for in life and God helps us immensely to create a masterpiece of a life if only we can be quiet, listen, and surrender to his will.   

So I tried that black label REWIRE today‚Ä¶ amazing the clarity about my own life I was graciously gifted with!  Best way I can describe it is a direct link with God.  I‚Äôve become acutely aware of all my blessings and am so grateful for everything!  I‚Äôve also become aware that there‚Äôs literally no upper limit to the degrees of love and gratitude one can feel through connection and relationship with God, self, and others.

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends' Trinity supplement for several years. Initially, it seemed expensive, but after doing thorough research and experiencing its benefits firsthand, I now see its value and will continue using it indefinitely. I took a year off during the pandemic due to financial struggles, which I now regret. Trinity has been instrumental in stabilizing my mood, eliminating severe mood swings, and improving my overall quality of life. Taking a small portion daily with my coffee has made a significant difference, and I‚Äôve even recommended it to friends.

Not only has Trinity improved my mental well-being, but it also helped me overcome addiction. The clarity it provides allowed me to realign with my true self and pursue a healthier lifestyle. The cost, just under $300 for a year's supply, equates to about a dollar a day, making it a worthwhile investment. Gavin's support through Facebook and personal texts is exceptional, adding even more value to this product.

If you struggle with mood swings, depression, or addiction, I urge you to try Trinity. It has truly changed my life. The best decision I made was starting with Trinity and getting back on it after a hiatus.

Interstellar Blends have been a transformative addition to my family's daily routine. As a real consumer since 2019, with a last order number of 59866 from May 2024, I have experienced significant personal benefits since incorporating these blends into our lives. Personally, I have lost a substantial amount of weight with THERMO, which has not only improved my physical health but also boosted my overall confidence. The blends AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN have been instrumental in helping me focus and maintain the energy and cognitive focus needed during the entirety of my doctorate program. Their impact has extended beyond just me, proving beneficial for my entire family in various ways.

My husband has also seen remarkable improvements in his health since using Interstellar Blends. He has successfully lost weight with THERMO as well as AUTOPHAGY and, more importantly, managed to combat the constant pain caused by inflammation with ASCENDANCE. He has healed his stomach ulcers with HELICO as well. He takes SHILAJIT daily, as he is super active and needs his electrolytes replenished quickly. Additionally, he has gained better control over his temper thanks to REWIRE, leading to a more harmonious household. Our son, who began using the blends to enhance his cognitive abilities, has seen incredible results. At just 13 years old, he was able to start college, a milestone we attribute largely to the benefits of also taking AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN blends. He uses PEEL and SPICE when he goes overboard at the gym and never feels sore!

The benefits of Interstellar Blends do not stop there. My 100-year-old grandmother uses THROM to dissolve a blood clot and LUNG POWER for her COPD, showcasing their wide-ranging efficacy. We all rely on these blends for overall wellness and as a preventive measure against common illnesses. In times of sickness, VICTORIOUS blend has been our go-to remedy to combat germs and promote faster recovery.

Wanted to leave this review to put on display what this legend has created.

I‚Äôm a real customer, and have been for the last 3-4 years. I‚Äôve had some truly life-changing results with the interstellar blends. When I started, this was about weight loss. I weighed over 300 lbs, and now I‚Äôm down to 220 lbs and feeling better than ever. The weight loss was natural and gradual, if I had taken it more seriously, I‚Äôd be well under 200 lbs by now, but that‚Äôs not my goal. It all began with the weight loss, but as I learned more about their products, I found myself diving into a rabbit hole of their high-quality blends. My last order was #63851, and I‚Äôve been using blends like Trinity, Victorious, Shilajit, Peel, Spice, Nebula, and Spaceborn. Each of these blends works great on its own, but together, they create a holistic approach to wellness that‚Äôs just incomparable.

Trinity has been a lifesaver for managing my stress, helping me to really excel at work which is high stress most of the time. Victorious, the anti-viral blend, kept my family and me healthy and worry-free, even when the world was in chaos. I have a few herniated discs in my neck, and the pain was unbearable. But Peel and Spice have been amazing for helping get rid of most if not alol, of the inflammation and pain. Instead of going through with surgery, I opted for physical therapy and these blends, and I haven‚Äôt looked back in three years. I‚Äôm so grateful for what Gavin has created here.

If you‚Äôre thinking about changing your health for the better with QUALITY products, look no further. This brand offers a ton of life-changing blends, and you can see it in the countless testimonials and reviews from other customers. These products are truly your last stop for supplements. The positive reviews and real-life testimonials say it all. If you want the highest quality supplements and are ready to make a real change, this is the place to start.

12056,Interstellar_Blends,"My Favorites! Wowza!

Let me review my very favorite blends. I have tried quite a few.

First, I started using Interstellar Blends over 5 years ago. I started with the Peel blend which helps with keeping blood sugars down. I used a blood glucose monitor to track my morning blood fasting levels each day to see if the blend really affected my glucose. Sure enough, a few weeks later, my readings were consistently in the 80-90 range upon waking, rather than 120. So I kept taking the Peel blend. I kind of began to crave it. A few months later, I noticed that in addition to my reduced glucose levels I was also not getting the colds and flu even when everyone else in the house got sick. Wow! Peel has remained a daily blend for me ever since.

My second blend that was life-changing was Trinity. This blend helps with anxiety. I am truly one of those adaptable, I can handle anything kind of people. Until I wasn't. With perimenopause came some real deep anxiety and strong emotions that were rough. I was crying, my hisband asking what was wrong. I would tearfully say, ""I don't know!"" I started on Trinity and a week later, no more tightness in the chest. No more tears. I went along like this for a few months and ran out of my Trinity. I had no clue how much it was helping until I DIDN'T have it. The crash of anxiety and sadness came back in a swoop until I could get more ordered and taken for a couple days. But that is the cool thing about Trinity. It doesn't dull emotions or make you feel flat like some medications. It just makes you feel like a regular person again. I will never again let myself run out of this blend.

Right now I am experimenting with a few of the newer blends that help with metabolism and weight loss. NRF-2, Trigliceride, Fatty Liver, and Ceramide are some of the blends in the mix. I've struggled with weight gain with perimenopause and decided to tackle the issue. In 2 months I have lost 21 pounds and still losing. The online community for Interstellar Blends is incredibly supportive and I am motivated to continue my weight loss journey supported by the blends.

I tell anyone who will listen how life-changing and health-supportive these blends are. I cannot recommend them more highly.

Since June 2019, Interstellar Blends have transformed my life. Struggling with severe depression and cognitive issues, I reached out to Gavin, who suggested the Seven Sages and Trinity blends. Skeptical but desperate, I tried them due to the money-back guarantee.

Amazingly, by the third day, my depression and anxiety were gone. After 22 years of trying various treatments, nothing worked as quickly or effectively. These blends not only lifted my depression but also improved my memory and overall brain function.

I used to struggle with completing tasks and had disorganized thoughts. Now, I can easily finish tasks and think clearly. Encouraged by Gavin, I completed a 66/6 challenge, losing 32 lbs in 12 days. I also won blends that I now use daily.

I came to Interstellar after years of losing the battle to Lyme disease. Interstellar Blends & their recommended protocol is the BEST solution to chronic Lyme disease. I spent years going from dr to dr & treatment to treatment that did nothing but erode my health further & introduce me to new issues and awful side effects. In fact I ended up with a serious Stephen Johnson Syndrome reaction with extreme burns on my face & chest from the drs recommended meds. I struggled with cardiac issues & neurological issues for years. Once I made the commitment to interstellar blends & the recommendations from the team there everything with my health fell back in to place & put me back in control of my health. And I came out at my peak health & wellness that I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life.

12063,Interstellar_Blends,"the Best plant blends in the world

 I am a real customer, this is my last order #69039 from 7/8/2024  date. I have been using Interstellar blends for 10 years.  I am a health coach and personal trainer.  I have access to tons of supplements and companies asking me to promote their product.  I have extremely skeptical of any product in todays world.  



I know that interstellar blends have saved my life. literally.  I have only half a pancreas and no gallbladder due to a cancer scare.  It did turn out that I did not have cancer. I believe because I had been taking the blends prior.  I can't prove it, but I do know it was flooding my body for a few years prior.



Since my surgery, I have trouble with absorption issues.  I have pass food quickly, so getting the nutrients I need to be healthy depends on micronutrition  daily.  Meaning that I need tons for plants to flood my body.



I am 62 years old and work as a personal trainer and the blends have been amazing to help me with muscle strenght and muscle gain,  It also has been my solution for my menopause,  I have had sucess with managing my menopause.  



I have nothing but amazing things to say about the results with the blends.  I also love the customer service, from the owners, to the amazing staff.  



Anytime I have needed questions answered, or support,   Gavin and Kristine have been amazing.  They also continually encourage and empower me to be a better version of myself.  



I have worked with a lot of companies as a coach and trainer,  Interstellar Blends, has the best customer service I have ever had.





I can absolutely attest that..... they are the best product on the market to target any health issue.

12064,Interstellar_Blends,"Turning potentiality into actuality . Review on AUTONOMOUS blend. 

I can attest that as a real customer having ordered a few blends from Interstellar over the last couple years,¬† my most recent order ([#66201 ](https://theinterstellarplan.com/my-account/view-order/66201/))¬† was placed on May 12, 2024,¬† in which I ordered my absolute bespoke blend AUTONOMOUS along with some Samples. Out of all the blends in the Interstellar catalog ( all are great ) this blend doubles as Neuro-protective and also as Neuro-enhancing since all these ingredients work synergistically in a way that other nootropic products currently on the market today do not.¬† The amount of research that has gone into creating it. With all the medically / clinically well-researched ingredients, it indicates clearly this was devised from the astute mind of an individual who is well-read on all the aspects of alternative and medical research studies.¬†

Do you need an edge when it comes to taking tests / creative tasks requiring great mental fortitude?¬† Then AUTONOMOUS is what I have used personally to ace several civil engineering tests that all required much logical, mathematical, and mechanical reasoning.¬† Some of us find it very hard to turn potentiality into actuality and to manifest one‚Äôs will into the world.¬† And for such a reason alone AUTONOMOUS¬†will always be part of my daily personal stack.¬†

Moreover, as a musician/ composer, it has helped me to finish projects that ordinarily I would have found WAY too complex and boring even to attempt.¬† Using this one blend alone has enriched my ‚Äú inner life ‚Äú so to speak in more ways than one.¬† Giving me a newfound sense of creativity, that can only come from a place of authentic self-expression.¬†",2024-07-24 21:16:45,18,0,0.9326,1,1,1.0

Happy to share my review and testimonial!   
  
I am a satisfied, real customer of Interstellar Blends. My most recent order #67120 was made on May 27, 2024. These blends last a long time! I love them and am excited to order more.  
  
I currently use Rewire, Trinity, ACB, Spice and Peel daily - they are the first thing I put into my body in the morning. I just add them to hot water and personally, love the taste. A bit bitter. Real medicine for the body and mind.  
  
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2024 and these blends have been an instrumental part of my natural recovery, along with other healthy lifestyle choices such as nutrition and exercise. These blends help me feel energetic and clear-minded. The morning blend routine gets me through the day, but I will sometimes take them 2-3 times a day when I need an extra boost.  
  
These blends are the real deal. The company owner responds very quickly and personally to any inquiries you may have, and there is an incredible amount of research and information available on the website to educate oneself. I am so grateful!",2024-07-24 20:48:52,17,0,0.9725,1,1,1.0
12066,Interstellar_Blends,"Diverse amount of Blends and herbs designed to assist as stated with Amazing Potency

I have placed several orders from Interstellar  most recent being - Order #39733 from late last year and I can assure you the herbs are indeed as mentioned and work on a subtle yet palpable manner.  The owner is knowledgeable, helpful and active online and he walks it like he talks it.  He is in great shape, youthful and an amazing creative person and musician.  There are many avant garde blends and new formulas that address many of the barren and unchecked issues many of us face living in the modern world and they work very nicely and not harshly so works better in long run  rather than harsh rx drugs. His products and shipping prices are reasonable and he will work with you to get your goals accomplished with even certain groups for weight loss  etc.  A very sincere and transparent guy whom I appreciate.

My favorite is paraslayer and I take it with grapefruit juice.  The bitterness and ingredient list is the first and one of a kind.  The effects are second to none.  Works great for critters or mold.  Also helps me to balance my liver  from years of too much fructose.  It helps to also take the spaceborn  mushroom blend here  or do enemas to really flush out the amoebas  etc.  Most other herbal concoctions in ref to this fall short and really just have only basics such as black walnut, pumpkin seeds, wormwood  etc.  This one is ultimate super charged formula with a long list of natural herbs and plants to assist.

My 2nd favorite is jing force and it helps to mainly tone the kidneys and adrenals - something everyone needs nowadays.  High cortisol can wreck havoc and this is the only blend that I have tried  that allows me to not get bloated  even when fasting or upon waking up.  It also helps me to have steady energy throughout the day as I am not a caffeine nor coffee person and I like it better than herbs like rhodiola and similar.

The herbs come in nice resealable bags and bpa free and the paraslayer one is a nice lime green and other blends just as colorful with nice stickers to boot  if aesthetics are your thing and often a shaker bottle or similar can be obtained for free if certain order amount and similar gifts.  I highly recommend Interstellar Blends on FB and the website for perusing and  purchasing.

Order # 67288 6/3/2024
Interstallar blends saved my life after brain surgery!!! 

October 2022 I underwent the pinacle of brain surgery, having a meningioma removed from my brain stem. My spinal cord was almost completely pinched off from the tumor. I had been having headaches from hell and numbness in my limbs.. Went to a Dr and told them I was pretty sure I had a tumor and pointed to where. He dismissed it as tension headaches, 'common to women' and tried to throw steroids and muscle relaxers at me.. Fast forward a few months.. After 2 nights of no sleep and entire body clenched from the pain I went to the ER. They rushed me for tests, discovered the tumor and scheduled surgery for the next day.. The operation went perfect and I was on cloud 9 just to be alive for 1 month, I honestly wondered if they had knicked something and left me a little special because the vibrancy of life was beautifully overwhelming.. so many humble happy tears..  until one day it was like a dark cloud crashed on me and I all of a sudden had overwhelming anxiety and depression and those tears turned to hopelessness...   For months I resisted using pharma to treat the symptoms of a TBI from surgery. It was so tempting and I almost caved but I didn't... I couldn't leave my bed without being overwhelmed with a wave of anxiety and overwhelm trying to take me out and would run back to fetal position, pray for help and try to replace each rancid thought.. I'd try to get up again and catch up but I just couldn't no matter how hard I tried. I closed out the world, sent my children away with family... it was pure hell.. 

I discovered Gavins blends and my hope was peaked while reading the testimonials, so I reached out for recommendations and was told to try Trinity and Rewire. I am forever grateful to God and Gavin for these blends as my anxiety lessened, I started to feel more like myself again. The depression and darkness loosened it's grip gradually until 1 day it was just not there anymore. It'd been a struggle financially to catch back up and so there were a few months that I couldn't afford the blends. The anxiety and overwhelm came back with a vengeance and I knew I had to fight through to somehow get more blends asap. My body was crying out for them. Within a couple days of starting the blends back up I was back to good, and the anxiety and depression were replaced with calm gratitude and steady focus. Before, it was like my thought process would just evaporate or fall off a cliff and I'd have zero recollection of conversations or my points, that all stopped with the blends.  Amazing! I went from hanging on by a thread to having clarity peace and joy again!
 
I also used Gavins 'Sabertooth' for tooth and gum pain that had became pretty consistent. I made a toothpaste and also took it. I have had ZERO pain in my teeth or gums since that 1 sample ... 

I am forever grateful for these blends and the powerful natural medicinals contained therein. I am so grateful for Gavin for seeing it through and also to those who left their testimonials!

Three Months In ‚Äì Real Results, No BS

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends for three months, and the results are legit.

Started with Rewire and immediately felt the brain kick. After I gave Gavin a full breakdown of what I was dealing with, he put together a personalized stack. I ended up going with the $777 package, which came with 18 blends total. He even threw in a couple extras. Texting with him is quick and direct‚Äîsuper helpful.

Favorites so far:
	‚Ä¢	Thunder ‚Äì hits even at half dose
	‚Ä¢	Nebula ‚Äì clean, sustained energy
	‚Ä¢	Ascendance ‚Äì crushing 20 years of chronic pain
	‚Ä¢	HELICOBACTER ‚Äì completely ended my nightly heartburn, got me back to mouth taping after 3 months off
	‚Ä¢	Purge ‚Äì steady, no-pressure weight loss over the last few months

His pine pollen is top-tier. I tried a replacement off Amazon‚Äîtasted like cardboard. Got a refund and went back to the real deal.

Biggest shift: I‚Äôve decided to come off TRT after a year. These blends gave me the confidence and physical support to make that call.

I recently experienced an incredible journey with Autonomous Rewire and Trinity, paired with deep meditation. I believe I reached the ultimate state of zen.

I floated around my house and even observed my dad sleeping. It was an awesome experience‚Äîuntil I encountered some things I wasn't quite prepared for during my second attempt.

  


In previous discussions with my group, we explored these topics extensively, and I want to emphasize the importance of being spiritually ready for such experiences. I am truly grateful for Gavin's work; he is incredibly dedicated and outworks everyone out there. After just two days of using Autonomous, I feel like I've returned to 100% hustle‚Äîmy focus and motivation are at an all-time high.

  


Autonomous has been a game-changer for managing my ADHD; nothing else has worked as effectively for me. However, I urge everyone to know their limits when it comes to practices like astral projection and lucid dreaming.¬†

12081,Interstellar_Blends,"Gavin changed my life. 25 BLEND MEGA COMBO !!!!

What‚Äôs up, everybody! I just had to share my immense gratitude and the life-changing experience I‚Äôve had with Gavin‚Äôs creation Interstellar Blends.

My name is Francis, I‚Äôm 28, and I‚Äôm from Quebec, Canada. To give you some context, I‚Äôm workin four jobs, 3 are extremely physical, and the 4th is trading which demand alot of mental power and focus. In the summer, I work 16 to 18 hours a day, sometimes even more. It‚Äôs absolutely draining.

By the end of 2023, my body and mind hit a breaking point. The nonstop grind caught up.. I hit a wall make of fuc‚Ä¶. titanium‚Ä¶ My whole system was shutdown, It got me crazy health issues.. I was dealing out of nowhere with fungal infections, constant headaches, autoimmune flare-ups, MCAS, and a completely wrecked nervous system. My nervous system was so shut, I was shaking when standing up, my whole mind was in the dark,, depressive spiral, and I started having thoughts I‚Äôd never wish on anyone, it was HELL‚Ä¶.

That‚Äôs when, by the grace of God, Gavin announced a challenge to win a 25 Blend Mega Combo and guess what? My friend and I WON! This was a blessing because I had no idea how to recover from this hole I was in..

When the package arrived, it was game on! I immediately started fasting with the blends and water for six days to start my recovery ASAP. Normally fasting for me is kinda Hard and by day 2 Im half dead in my bed wondering why the F I started a fast LOL , I‚Äôd be drained, barely functioning. but with the blends is another dimension literally..! It didnt felt like a was fasting AT ALL.

By the 2rd day, I was sleeping like a Rock which I wasnt able to do for at least 1y, and waking up feeling like a whole new person. I couldn‚Äôt believe how effortless fasting felt. For anyone who struggles with fasting, seriously, reach out to Gavin. Just follow the steps Gavin gives you, and you‚Äôll be golden Fast!

After the 6 day fast, I broke the fast with some worries because I have bad experience of refeeding in the past. Ive put the worries aside and broke the fast the best I could, and‚Ä¶. Not a SINGLE issues! No histamine flares up, no pain, nothing!. This blew my mind because I‚Äôve had severe digestive problems since I was 5yo, like MCAS, SIBO, SIFO, and mold toxicity. In the past, fasting always came with nasty, crazy symptoms, especially during refeeding. But with the blends, I bounced back like I never though possible. TONS of energy, laser focus for trading and vitality was through the roof.

I‚Äôve done ALOT lab testing the past 5years to track pathogens, deficiencies, and other health issues. After just one month on the blends, I did the same lab test and 80% of the issues, pathogen and defiencies were completely rGONE . In one freaking month.. It still doesnt make sense to me LOLL Good luck finding a doctor that will do that for you‚Ä¶

On top of that, my hair is growing back after starting to bald at 23! Super Tonic Hair for the win! Talking about Wins.. LOL If you ever had ED type of issues‚Ä¶. Thunder is quite insane and effective‚Ä¶ I will no into details but It was life changing for multiple person AHAH

If you have digestive issues you HAVE to take the Stomach Reset Combo. The first 3 day with the Purge can be a mess, It was for me. But after the big clean up, it feels like you are flying, heaviness is lifted from your soul!

I cant thank Gavin enough for this incredible opportunity. The timing was divine and it saved my life. I wasnt sure how I‚Äôd pull myself out of this mess I was in , but with God‚Äôs grace, I took the chance and it was worth it 10000%

Now, still thriving! I gave some of the blends to close familly member espacially Victorious when they got Cov. Victo with Peels and Spice Got Cov down in 2 days ! This is revolutionary lol.

Ecstatic Effects: How It Feels

The effects are almost immediate: a sense of calm and what I would actually describe as ""bliss"" washes over your mind and body. The feeling of not needing or wanting anything, because for once, you just feel satisfied is incredible. If you're used to your mind constantly racing-- get ready for silence! This blend is literally a game-changer if you have trouble meditating or focusing. 

If you are suffering from anxiety,  depression,  stress or even just trying to change your mindset and be more positive,  try Ecstatic. I haven't experienced any negative side effects from it, I doubt you can say that about any prescription medication for treating anxiety and depression!

If you‚Äôre serious about fasting and want to take your wellness journey to the next level, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is your ultimate ally. As someone who has embraced fasting as a core part of my health regimen, I can confidently say this blend has been instrumental in supporting my longest fast to date‚Äî6 full days!

What sets this blend apart is how it provides sustained energy and stamina, even during extended periods without food. Normally, by day three or four, fatigue starts to creep in, making it challenging to stay focused and energized. But with ECSTATIC, I felt a clear, steady flow of energy that kept me going, never feeling like I was about to hit a wall or collapse from exhaustion.

This blend not only fuels my body but also sharpens my mental clarity, allowing me to maintain productivity and focus throughout my fast. I found myself thinking clearer, feeling more present, and even having an enhanced sense of wellbeing, all without the usual brain fog that accompanies prolonged fasting.

For anyone looking to explore the transformative power of extended fasting while maintaining optimal energy levels and mental acuity, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is the key. It‚Äôs more than just a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolutionary tool for anyone looking to push their limits and achieve a new state of wellness.

I've been taking Interstellar Blends for several years now. My absolute must-haves are peel, spice and victorious. When I get the sniffles, half a teaspoon of victorious + 1/4 teaspoon of the others knocks it right out. I also love the beauty blend, and I notice a definite difference in my skin when I use it regularly.  But my biggest testament to Interstellar blends is for the use of hypertension.  I was diagnosed with hypertension after childbirth. I went to doctor after doctor and none could figure it out. In the years post-partum, I exercised regularly, fasted, walked miles per day and still had hypertension. ""Well, some people just have this problem and we don't know why. Take these pills"". So, I took the pills and they kept adding different pills and changing dosages and it didn't get better. I was young enough that I couldn't accept that this would be my life. So I reached out to Gavin and he recommended apigenin, aldosterone down-regulator, jing force and pulsar. I used them and reversed my hypertension in a few months.

I recently spent six months traveling across various countries, and one of the best decisions I made was to bring along Interstellar Blends' Gainz blend. Long-term travel can be incredibly taxing on both body and mind‚Äîirregular sleep, constant changes in time zones, and unpredictable diets can all add up to leave you feeling worn out. Luckily, Gainz came to my rescue.

Right from the start, Gainz was an absolute game-changer. I felt an impressive boost in  physical energy. I was amazed at how well I could bounce back the next day. 

The most remarkable thing about Gainz was its impact on muscle recovery and overall stamina. As someone who tries to stay fit even on the road, it‚Äôs usually tough to maintain consistency with workouts while traveling, but Gainz made it much easier. My muscle soreness was significantly reduced, and my energy levels remained steady, which kept me motivated to get those quick workouts in whenever I had the chance.

I only used Trinity twice a day, fast forward 6 months I decided to give it another go this time adding Nebula and Autonomous with Trinity and took them all separately twice a day while following a strict 22-2 fast routine after cleansing myself with a 72hr fast. HOLY. SHIT. The results came much faster than I expected. I felt so amazing every day it was almost breathtaking how good I was feeling day in and day out. Before I struggled with mental health issues‚Ä¶. And what was strange I was doing very similar things as when I struggled with my mental health. The difference was now I was fasting and taking the blends. I just felt so much more energetic, calm, loving and outgoing. Even sometimes working out 2-3 times a day because I could!!! 11/10 could not recommend these products enough, they really helped me out of a dark place mentally and I appreciate all the work Gavin does for his team.

Ive been taking interstellar blends for 8 years and it has completely transformed my health. Ive been fasting for 5 years with 22/2 and had no problems with fasting.

12091,Interstellar_Blends,"Ecstatic is AMAZING!!! üòç

For the past five days, I've been taking four scoops of Trinity, two scoops of Ecstatic, and two scoops of Ascendance in a cup of black coffee. For reference, each scoop is equivalent to 1/8 of a teaspoon. 

Apart from this, I've been consuming nothing else for the rest of the day, except for a sip of water when my mouth feels dry. I wanted to see what Ecstatic can do on its own, and I added Trinity and Ascendance because I've been doing a lot of moving this week and I'm on my menstrual cycle.

The results have been significant. I now easily eat just once a day. In fact, I actually have to remind myself to eat, and I'm not really hungry. I just feel like I should eat something nutritious. This is a huge change for me because I usually want (and eat) any and everything during my menstrual cycle. 

It's a strange feeling to not be thinking about eating food all day. This is doubly significant because I'm visiting my hometown, Chicago, right now and I was worried about how I was going to manage because of all the incredible food here that's comforting to me. But I haven't even wanted anything in the four days I've been here, thanks to Ecstatic.

I almost forgot to mention that I drove from Houston to Chicago straight through. It was an 18-hour drive with no food (just the blends I mentioned earlier) and a little tiredness. The last time I did this trip, I had to stop overnight and sleep. Not this time.

One of the most impactful experiences has been the guidance Gavin provided to my dad after his recent heart attack. Understanding the critical importance of diet in recovery, LDL vs HDL, Gavin spent hours discussing tailored dietary changes and specific products that would support my dad's healing process. He not only recommended specific blends and amounts, but he recommended products such as a specific olive oil from another company. His recommendations have made a significant difference, providing my father with the tools he needs to reclaim his health, vitality and stay off dangerous drugs such as Statins.

12093,Interstellar_Blends,"Top review for Spice and Peel Herbs 

Having relocated to Texas over a decade ago, I found myself facing the harsh realities of seasonal allergies, particularly due to the high levels of cedar pollen. Initially, my experience was frustrating and debilitating, as I frequently battled upper respiratory infections and bronchitis, often accompanied by a relentless cough. While my doctor prescribed Claritin D and regular Claritin, I quickly became dependent on these medications just to feel somewhat functional. 

After several years of this struggle, I began to notice some unwanted side effects from daily use, particularly persistent constipation. Despite trying teas and other remedies, nothing seemed to provide the relief I desperately needed‚Äîuntil about a year ago, when a friend introduced me to the Purge herb from Interstellar Herbs. This particular herb worked wonders for me, sparking my curiosity to explore their other offerings. I decided to try the Spice and Peel herbs for my allergies. I will admit, there was some hesitation on my part; I had grown so reliant on Claritin D that I was apprehensive about going a day without it. I even contemplated my doctor‚Äôs advice to undergo testing, but it required me to be off the medication for at least a week.

When I finally mustered the courage to take the leap, I was astonished. That very first night, I was free of congestion, and the next morning, I could finally breathe through both nostrils‚Äîsomething that had become a rarity for me. It was a moment of realization; I had become addicted to pseudoephedrine, a substance commonly used in the creation of meth. My last order (#67603) in June 2024 included these two amazing herbs, and I can't express how grateful I am that they worked. These herbs are truly life-changing for me, and I wholeheartedly recommend Interstellar Herbs to everyone struggling with similar issues. If you're searching for natural, effective relief from allergies, look no further than Interstellar Herbs!

12096,Interstellar_Blends,"NATURE‚ÄôS SUPERPOWER

This is a testimonial to confirm that I am a legitimate and returning customer of the Interstellar Blends \[Last order #68857 on 6/6/2024\] and have been taking them daily for the past four years.

Interstellar was introduced to me by my son, after I have been treating post op breast cancer in 2017/18 without any chemo, radiotherapy or hormone pills, and was researching and trying various natural alternatives, such as detox, fasting, change of diet, Rick Simpson Oil, essential oils, medicinal mushrooms, vitamins and supplements. I was making good progress, but with the blends, it took me to another level, both physically and mentally!!

Started with the full arsenal: 7 Sages, ACB, Senolitic, Luteolin, Autophagy, Peel, Spice, Glucose Blocker, Trinity, Autonomous, Victorious, Paraslayer, Shilajit and Matcha. Combined with regular intermittent fasting and mostly paleo diet, my health improved exponentially. I also felt much less anxious about the future, and Gavin‚Äôs expert advice, whenever I had a question, was really helpful.

Since then I also cycled various other blends: Nebula, Jing Force, Purge, Hypnotic, Anti-adipogenic, Thermo, Superhair, Plush, Rewire, Spaceborn and my health continued to improve. During that time I most incredibly managed to stop vaping Cannabis, which I had been using for stress and back pain and couldn‚Äôt imagine going without. Now I don‚Äôt miss it at all!

Most recently I added Titanium, Gainz, Sabretooth, Ocular, Anti-fatigue, NRF2 and GLP-1 activator in the mix, as I am getting older and accidentally broke my arm. My physiotherapist was seriously impressed with the speedy recovery, especially the fast return to my normal strength, even though I‚Äôm not very keen on the resistance or weights exercising. I prefer gardening and dogwalking.

On top of all these personal benefits, our 13y old Bulldog cross Staffie, who had two surgeries to remove mast cell tumours, at 10y & 12y, is now also on daily blends (ACB, Senolytic, Peel, Spice and Shilajit) and still going strong, running around the local parks and fields and enjoying life. Her new nickname is Indestructible.

In short, these blends helped me thrive following a cancer battle, effortlessly kick long term Cannabis addiction, vastly improve my mental health and heal a spiral fracture of the Humerus in record time. My son also benefited in numerous ways, the latest example being that he regrew part of his his gum with Sabretooth, but I will let him write his own review.

So I can attest that as a family, we are very real and regular customers of Interstellar! Coffee and blends in the morning has become a firm ritual to start of every day. At 55 I am much healthier and in better mental state than I was ten years ago. My next project is to utilise the blends to build muscle, increase fitness, immunity and brain power, to carry me strong and happy into the autumn of my life.

I started using the blends a few years ago but fell off the wagon and after I gained so much weight and my knees were hurting so much because of the extra weight that I could barely go up and down the stairs when I decided this is not life so I decided to take the bull by the horns and get control of my life so my last order was for the challenge combo order # 70123 from August 12 2024.  
  
I can honestly testify that in a few weeks has changed my life. I have lost 4 lbs. and now it is not so painful to go up and down the stairs since I live on the 3rd floor, my energy has improved as well as my focus. I am able to fast from 7pm to noon the following day with no issues and this was something I never thought possible since I was a junk food lover ¬†and being Latin American where all we eat is carbs has not made it easy. I plan to stick to this protocol ¬†and get the weight and my health to where it should be. I have two young kids and need all the energy I can get.¬†

I am a real customer. My last order number is #66268 on May 12, 2024. 

My favorite blends are Autonomous and Rewire, which guarantee incredible relief from stress, if you are someone who has a lot of stress during the day, these 2 blends will help you a lot. Another favorite blend is Purge, if you want to feel like a new person, this blend is something incredible and indescribable. (you really feel better after it!!!)

If you want to feel unstoppable and have an incredible amount of energy, then Supernova or Nebula is what will help you tremendously.

If you think that blends are expensive, think about how much you spend per month on alcohol, drugs or junk food and then you will realize that they are not expensive at all and last a really long time. 

I recommend them to everyone who wants to take their health to the next level.  Thank you Interstellar!

So, came across this site along my journey, and was recommended to check out the blends. This was exactly what I was searching for. Herbal blends to aid my daily life (exercising, dieting, meditating, etc, etc), as I believe unfortunately we are unable to get all the goodness from foods alone in this day in age.

¬†I am a real person, not an AI bot or similar, I am not perfect, and do go through my fair share of struggles. This is a true review and testimonial.

¬†I have ordered a few times but one of my last orders was in April 2024 - #63876. I stocked up for the year. The blends are mixed with my morning coffee, and not only does the caffeine wake me up, but the herbal blends also fire up the correct receptors and I have no brain fog at all. I am able to focus in and get on with my day at work, no stopping fir umming and rrring, I am straight there and straight up with the answers. My brain loves the stuff.

¬†Not only for my brain but also for my body, my body feels good and can feel my digestion is a lot better. Once the digestion was sorted it helped me in other areas of my life. I am not as tired during the day, no more afternoon naps. I also have enough energy to hit the gym in a fasted state.

¬†All my blends are consumed in the morning whilst in a fasted state and I take with coffee. You can take it with matcha tea as well if you like.

¬†On another note, I also tried a newer blend ""Rewire"". I ordered this initially to aid me wean of certain substances which I should not have been taking. Not only did it help with my cravings, I felt it also helped me sleep at night (which was always an issue in the past when trying to quit). I finished the pack and never felt better. I wish I found these blends a decade ago.

¬†I highly recommend trying some of the blends, have a look on the website, there will something for everyone. We do not get the nutrients in the foods as we did 50 years ago, and with ultra processed foods which has swamped our markets everything little bit helps, and we should all find something to aid our daily living, along with the right diet and exercise.

¬†Give these guys a go, you won't regret it. I have ordered several times and will continue to order into my old age.",2024-08-28 09:27:11,18,0,0.9901,1,1,1.0

Autonomous is my absolute favorite blend, with Nebula a close second for boosting my willpower. Health is a holistic journey, and these blends are a powerful tool in conjunction with diet, fasting, meditation, exercise etc. for becoming SUPERHUMAN!  
  
As a woman who goes through cycles, the Fertility blend is my favorite for nurturing my YIN and managing my cycles with ease and grace. I‚Äôve only tried one sample so far but will order more. Alongside Autonomous and Fertility, 7 Sages is becoming a new favorite, offering variety and activating different areas each day.

I have been on this journey with Gavin since 2020 and his blends absolutely changed my life.



I found him through the trading community where some buddies of mine recommended me his Trinity and Nebula for trading. And boy did it make a difference.



I wanted my parents to get me some of his blends, and upon inspection that my father did, he said that Gavin must be a scammer for there is no such thing as perfect reviews. So they didn't buy the blends for me. 



But I trusted my trading buddies and wanted to at least give the man a shot to see if it makes a difference. 



I had to save up for a few months to get that $600 extra cash for 2 big bags of blends. And I was praying that it will work since it was hard back then for me to get my hands on that much money. 



After the two bags of Nebula and Trinity arrived, in 3 days of fasting + blends genuinely eliminated my anxiety, depression and tension, and completely restructured my presence. I had severe ADHD and 1/4 of tsp of Trinity and Nebula made me present, here and now.



3 months later I had my first profitable trading month in Forex.



NOTE: its not the blends that make you successful, but they are the key to easier achievement.



I could never trade and study 16h per day everyday for 3 months and put in the work without the blends. 



And if you think that is amazing, it was just the beginning. After hitting my first 10k month at age of 19, I got myself a shit ton of blends, and later down the line when his list of blends expanded, I am buying minimum of 15 different blends every single time...



Not only that, but I also had epilepsy, and I started to reject the poisonous pills that doctors gave me which had literally infinite negatives and only one potential positive.



With Alz, Lutein, Apigenin I have not had any more seizures, tho I believe there is more to it than blends. Gavin also got me on ketogenic diet, 22/2 fasting, one 3 day dry fast per quarter and one 3 day dry + 3 day water per year. 



I have studied epilepsy and seizures and made a huge leap for myself, 6 years seizure free and got my drivers license now. Thanks to blends, diet, lifestyle changes and mindset - I also helped a few others do the same... 



In the other review I forgot to mention that I am adrenaline addict and I do a lot of extreme sports. Nebula, Autonomous, Trinity, Rewire and Anti-Fatigue have helped me push the limits of the sports I am in, and I also gave the blends to my friends who went nuts for them. 



The blends work like a charm. But they are not magic. If you think you can drink alcohol, eat junk food, watch adult content and scroll social media and have the blends cope for all the negatives, you are mistaken. Blends are enhancers, boosters, rewards for correct behavior, not magic pill. Do your part and the blends will do theirs.



Needless to say Gavin's Interstellar Blends are a big part of my life for the past 4 years, and will continue to be.



For anyone thinking that his products are too expensive I say: Find me someone who offers even remotely close products and also ask yourself, how bad is your mindset that you are putting a price on your well-being and health....



If anyone has any doubts about what I wrote reach out to me, if you have any questions reach out, anything at all, just reach out, I am willing to help and give you a live testimony with more depth and more instructions. (Telegram, twitter, instagram, whatever, look up my name or handle u/giustix369, will vouch for Gavin any day!)



I already went on for too long, but you would as well if something literally changed your life and you see people hating on the guy that is helping thousands become self-actualized. Gavin answers questions, helps you out in DM's if you just ask. 



But yes it is true, HE WILL NOT TOLLERATE WEAK EXCUSE MAKING PEOPLE. 



Here in the Interstellar Blends community we strive to be excellent, to make the best version of ourselves and not compromise with anything. We break limits, we move mountains and we work together. 



Super community, super Gavin, super us!

Since I started drinking these incredible blends my memory is much better, my addiction to food is at its lowest ever, even when I have a ""cheat"" day and dont fast, I can eat breakfast at 8am and then eat my next meal at 3pm, that has never happened before, I always snacked. I can control my appetite like a boss! Always had an addiction to sweets but now sometimes in the evening I say to myself ""hmm, I didnt had anything sweet today, wtf"" and Im thankful to the blends for that, and yes you need to have some willpower and not be a pu$$ to start but once you get angry with yourself and set realistic, small-to-start-with goals, you will do it with ease.

Now my girlfriend is happy that I remember small things she tells me, I feel much better overall cause I don't always digest and have unlimited energy, Im way stronger in the gym (gainz) people tell me Im on steroids which I think is a joke but I take the complement haha, my brain works at 120%, much more organised and collected, I don't get stressed that much running my business and I got time to think and do other things other than previously making myself too much food, eat it and then feel bloated and sh1t for the rest of the day.

Not only does Gavin and his team provide exemplary customer service (responsive, informative & one-of-kind website) but the blends are unlike anything one can ever experience! I am truly grateful to have stumbled across it many years ago. Nebula, personally, has been an absolute game changer. Most would consider me as an introvert, non-confrontational... I absolutely dislike confrontations! Nebula provides that extra kick and adds confidence, warrior type spirit... I consider myself like Laura Croft from Tomb Raider when I take it, mentally ready for WHATEVER! Don't TRY me! Lol! 

I also recently purchased Seven Sages and it has been a pleasant change! Every day it's a different blend and it helps me move throughout my days-- as a homeschooling mom to two gifted and talented children and an investor, I need all the stamina, clarity,  focus, and energy I can get!

12134,Interstellar_Blends,"My Dryfasting Journey

I started dryfasting 2018 when I heard of it from the snake diet guy, later on I discovered the page dryfasting.com which lead me even deeper into the journey and provided very elaborate and scientifically backed information about dry fasting and it is when I first read about how herbal blends can support fasting and be combined with drytasting, where the effects of herbs are potentiated after dryfasts and they make fasting easier especially for overweight people.
After buying my first blends I could feel some distinct effects like restructuring in my spine, more energy, that I never felt from herbs like that before. I bought many herbal products, but these blends gave me the best results. I would say they are really close to giving you the maximum benefit you can reap from herbal products.
Later on I stumbled over the masterfastsystem, which gave me great relieve of symptoms and progress on my health journey in many ways and it helped me pull out a lot of mucoid plaque and all kinds of other nasty things, but since I have quite low bodyfat the masterfastsystem wasn't always suitable for me anymore because it pulled too much on my reserves over the years. Moreover I have concerns that it could age you too quickly, but it really helps me a lot if I do it sporadically.

So then I decided to buy a big stock of interstellarblends for the first time in 2022 to support me with fasting because I was sure I could trust that they give me a great effect. Without these blends I couldn't have done the first semester of my masters study (due to my health), I can feel them helping me in many ways, my collarbone, spine and skeleton shifted, my seasonal allergies improved, I could tolerate coffee with them again (I stopped drinking it though, cause I have nervous issues and I'm sensitive to them, they really help me to function in everyday life, I can feel my nervous system symptoms less (I have multiple sclerosis) even though I still am in a battle with my health issues, which is a great gift to me and is the reason why I became obsessed with the blends and would recommend them to all people who want to perform better, fast easier, live longer, but mainly to the sick people to make your everyday life quite a bit easier.

My goal now is to work myself up to longer dryfasts without depleting myself too much of nutrients. So the plan is that I try to get to the 3 day dryfasting mark (which is hard for me cause I'm an ectomorph, plus with certain health problems it can be harder) again as I have done in the past and in between refuel with healthy food and take the blends (which then are more effective after a longer dryfast) and then maybe after 2-3 weeks try my next long dryfast. I hope I can heal further by following this plan.",2024-08-02 10:28:19,18,0,0.9975,1,1,1.0
12135,Interstellar_Blends,"TRINITY IS THE BEST!

**Trinity** is the singular blend has fixed more issues for more people than I can count. The FB posts about this blend from people are just incredible! If you have a health or body/mind issue, then it‚Äôs very likely that this blend will drastically improve it. If you‚Äôre unsure, then send a message and ask! They‚Äôre very responsive and take customer service seriously.  
This is the highest quality most comprehensive herbal blend on the planet (except for Seven Sages which is still in beta). If you try just one blend this is the one to start with!  
No matter how bad a bad day is, it turns into a good day with Trinity. Just 1/8 to 1/4 tsp a day is plenty for most. Helps me to feel calm, clear, buoyant, naturally joyful and light, helps remove those feelings of depression, doom and gloom, where the world is caving in on you.  
Tired of life? Every day pretty much sucks? Can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt focus, tired all the time, can‚Äôt do family time at home or perform on the job anymore? Just wanna get away from everybody and be alone so you can sulk and eat ice cream and watch movies? Then get Trinity and feel joyful and young again! I take Trinity with Thermogenesis everyday, and add Pine Pollen with Supernova or the Original Blend on those days when I really need to rock and roll. Face wrinkles and skin issues are lessening. I look younger and have that inner glow again. No more sallow, tired, wrinkled, energyless, lifeless, deadbeat zombie face anymore. How many people out there look like zombies to you? Like they would rather curl up and die than live? Half if not most? Are you one of them? Tired of it? Then invest in yourself and buy these blends and get the show on the road! These herbal blends combined with 22/2 or 21/3 intermittent fasting are the most valuable life and health improvement tools I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôve been taking these blends for over a year and doing intermittent fasting for a month and it‚Äôs the best health change I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs anti-cancer too! So stop dilly dallying and just do it! (I‚Äôm not a salesmen and have never made a dime from these blends, and don‚Äôt want to!)

     I have tried many Interstellar Blends for mind and body. For the mind I have tried Nebula, Rewire, Trinity & Apigenin. For the body I have tried Plush & Super Tonic Hair. While all of these blends work great and have served their purpose I have found the most benefit from Autonomous & Heavy Metal Detox. 
     I have been diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage years & was never a fan of stimulant medication. Not only does it make me feel anxious but it also dampens my creativity. I work in the sound and music industry so taking my stimulant medication has a negative effect on my work. Autonomous has helped me have the initiative I need to start & finish my work while also maintaining my natural creativity. 
     I have had deep lines under my eyes & on my hands since childhood. I did more research & learned that this could be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. I decided to try the Heavy Metal Detox formula & it was definitely the answer to my problem. I feel like I have aged backwards! My hands look a lot healthier & the deep lines under my eyes have become more refined. I hope more people will try the Heavy Metal Detox formula as many Americans are exposed to heavy metals on a daily basis.

He posted a scientific study about a mouse literally being genetically predisposed to obesity, diabetes and so many other health problems.  They loaded him up on flavonoids such as citrus peel.  After the fact, they did everything to give this mouse sickness and he became a silver bullet to diseases.

From then on out these potent blends along with the protocol combining blends  diet and fasting  will get you to health in no time.

This blend absolutely blows any nootropic out of the water with what it can do in regard to brain fog, prolonged studying, alertness, reaction time, etc. This is a formula that one will notice effects from as soon as it is utilized, whether if it is used in conjunction with challenging brain tasks or not. The effects can be felt all day without any unpleasant side effects.

Any brain task will not only become much easier, but the results that are produced when put in use in any challenging obstacle will be of far greater quality. Test it out on any assignment you have with and without using this blend and it is a night and day difference. Not incorporating this into your daily tasks will put you at a decided disadvantage. After realizing what can be accomplished with this formula, you won't ever want to go without it.

I've been using this blend for years I have not had any tolerance build up to it and I definitely notice the difference if I stop taking it. This is a formula you always want to be stocked up on if you want to skyrocket your performance.

It was very relieving to see her take this pathway, and notice improvement in her life.

I love how balanced it makes me feel. A little under 2 years ago I was in an automobile accident and fractured my left clavicle and ankle. I immediately ordered and started using Titanium to support bone healing. I also experienced weight loss specifically muscle loss after the accident and have been using and loving Gainz. Before Gainz I was at 117# I could not gain weight (My ideal weight is 127-130#) It took a while and today I weight in at 127 and I have developed muscle strength again. 2 more wins came from Ocular, my vision has improved since using it and Sabre Tooth. Last dental cleaning was the best in a long time! I am about to place a new order as I am running low. Because I believe in these blends I have referred many friends and coaching clients to Gavin and his team.

Honestly my review for this blend kinda writes itself! I had been on Plush loading dose for only 9 days when I walked in to see my hair stylist and she immediately noticed that my skin was glowing -- even though I had a mask on, haha. She immediately asked me what I was doing and I knew it was the work of this magical blend. I had definitely begun to notice some subtle differences myself, but getting that validation from someone else who had no idea about it and so early on in the process was mindblowing.

Plush has a way of brightening and smoothing your complexion in a way that's hard to describe until you experience it. You can also tell a difference in skin texture after being on it for the loading dose period, and it usually doesn't take the full 2-3 weeks to start seeing noticeable results. 

I am 34 and have never done any cosmetic surgeries, injectables, etc. -- it's really important to me to maintain my beauty from a holistic and natural place. I'm already several years into an organic/biodynamic skincare regimen, so it has been exciting to find an herbal supplement that I can compliment that with to work on my beauty from the inside.

I was introduced to interstellar blends through a friend. I‚Äôve always been interested in natures medicine. When I first tried the trinity blend, after talking to Gavin (the owner) and asking plenty of questions, I was really pleased. I took it at around 6am on an empty stomach with my double espresso and it helped me stay focused and alert during my work, which requires attention and precision. I noticed the difference immediately.  

Thanks to everyone at interstellar!

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends' Trinity supplement for several years. Initially, it seemed expensive, but after doing thorough research and experiencing its benefits firsthand, I now see its value and will continue using it indefinitely. I took a year off during the pandemic due to financial struggles, which I now regret. Trinity has been instrumental in stabilizing my mood, eliminating severe mood swings, and improving my overall quality of life. Taking a small portion daily with my coffee has made a significant difference, and I‚Äôve even recommended it to friends.

Not only has Trinity improved my mental well-being, but it also helped me overcome addiction. The clarity it provides allowed me to realign with my true self and pursue a healthier lifestyle. The cost, just under $300 for a year's supply, equates to about a dollar a day, making it a worthwhile investment. Gavin's support through Facebook and personal texts is exceptional, adding even more value to this product.

If you struggle with mood swings, depression, or addiction, I urge you to try Trinity. It has truly changed my life. The best decision I made was starting with Trinity and getting back on it after a hiatus.

Interstellar Blends have been a transformative addition to my family's daily routine. As a real consumer since 2019, with a last order number of 59866 from May 2024, I have experienced significant personal benefits since incorporating these blends into our lives. Personally, I have lost a substantial amount of weight with THERMO, which has not only improved my physical health but also boosted my overall confidence. The blends AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN have been instrumental in helping me focus and maintain the energy and cognitive focus needed during the entirety of my doctorate program. Their impact has extended beyond just me, proving beneficial for my entire family in various ways.

My husband has also seen remarkable improvements in his health since using Interstellar Blends. He has successfully lost weight with THERMO as well as AUTOPHAGY and, more importantly, managed to combat the constant pain caused by inflammation with ASCENDANCE. He has healed his stomach ulcers with HELICO as well. He takes SHILAJIT daily, as he is super active and needs his electrolytes replenished quickly. Additionally, he has gained better control over his temper thanks to REWIRE, leading to a more harmonious household. Our son, who began using the blends to enhance his cognitive abilities, has seen incredible results. At just 13 years old, he was able to start college, a milestone we attribute largely to the benefits of also taking AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN blends. He uses PEEL and SPICE when he goes overboard at the gym and never feels sore!

The benefits of Interstellar Blends do not stop there. My 100-year-old grandmother uses THROM to dissolve a blood clot and LUNG POWER for her COPD, showcasing their wide-ranging efficacy.

Wanted to leave this review to put on display what this legend has created.

I‚Äôm a real customer, and have been for the last 3-4 years. I‚Äôve had some truly life-changing results with the interstellar blends. When I started, this was about weight loss. I weighed over 300 lbs, and now I‚Äôm down to 220 lbs and feeling better than ever. The weight loss was natural and gradual, if I had taken it more seriously, I‚Äôd be well under 200 lbs by now, but that‚Äôs not my goal. It all began with the weight loss, but as I learned more about their products, I found myself diving into a rabbit hole of their high-quality blends. My last order was #63851, and I‚Äôve been using blends like Trinity, Victorious, Shilajit, Peel, Spice, Nebula, and Spaceborn. Each of these blends works great on its own, but together, they create a holistic approach to wellness that‚Äôs just incomparable.

Trinity has been a lifesaver for managing my stress, helping me to really excel at work which is high stress most of the time. Victorious, the anti-viral blend, kept my family and me healthy and worry-free, even when the world was in chaos. I have a few herniated discs in my neck, and the pain was unbearable. But Peel and Spice have been amazing for helping get rid of most if not alol, of the inflammation and pain. Instead of going through with surgery, I opted for physical therapy and these blends, and I haven‚Äôt looked back in three years. I‚Äôm so grateful for what Gavin has created here.

If you‚Äôre thinking about changing your health for the better with QUALITY products, look no further. This brand offers a ton of life-changing blends, and you can see it in the countless testimonials and reviews from other customers. These products are truly your last stop for supplements. The positive reviews and real-life testimonials say it all. If you want the highest quality supplements and are ready to make a real change, this is the place to start.

12235,Interstellar_Blends,"My Favorites! Wowza!

Let me review my very favorite blends. I have tried quite a few.

First, I started using Interstellar Blends over 5 years ago. I started with the Peel blend which helps with keeping blood sugars down. I used a blood glucose monitor to track my morning blood fasting levels each day to see if the blend really affected my glucose. Sure enough, a few weeks later, my readings were consistently in the 80-90 range upon waking, rather than 120. So I kept taking the Peel blend. I kind of began to crave it. A few months later, I noticed that in addition to my reduced glucose levels I was also not getting the colds and flu even when everyone else in the house got sick. Wow! Peel has remained a daily blend for me ever since.

My second blend that was life-changing was Trinity. This blend helps with anxiety. I am truly one of those adaptable, I can handle anything kind of people. Until I wasn't. With perimenopause came some real deep anxiety and strong emotions that were rough. I was crying, my hisband asking what was wrong. I would tearfully say, ""I don't know!"" I started on Trinity and a week later, no more tightness in the chest. No more tears. I went along like this for a few months and ran out of my Trinity. I had no clue how much it was helping until I DIDN'T have it. The crash of anxiety and sadness came back in a swoop until I could get more ordered and taken for a couple days. But that is the cool thing about Trinity. It doesn't dull emotions or make you feel flat like some medications. It just makes you feel like a regular person again. I will never again let myself run out of this blend.

Right now I am experimenting with a few of the newer blends that help with metabolism and weight loss. NRF-2, Trigliceride, Fatty Liver, and Ceramide are some of the blends in the mix. I've struggled with weight gain with perimenopause and decided to tackle the issue. In 2 months I have lost 21 pounds and still losing. The online community for Interstellar Blends is incredibly supportive and I am motivated to continue my weight loss journey supported by the blends.

I tell anyone who will listen how life-changing and health-supportive these blends are. I cannot recommend them more highly.

I messaged Gavin with some issues I was having as far as anxiety and panic attacks. He Recommended that I would start to take Trinity along with nebula. I started to notice results in the first week. I was a lot calmer, and the panic attacks had slowed down. I continued taking the blends, and after the first month, my panic attacks were nonexistent, and my confidence had built up I felt like a new person. My wife even noticed a difference. I have taken the blends on and off and can definitely notice a difference when I don‚Äôt take them. Overtime I have tried several different blends from interstellar. They all have been amazing. These are quality blends that will heal the body. Interstellar is a quality company with quality products. The customer service is amazing. Gavin even gives away free blends with each order.

If you're on the hunt for life-changing herbs, your search ends here! I'm sharing my genuine feelings and experiences with these fantastic products. As a real customer, I can attest that my last order, #30847 from May 29, 2022, has truly been transformative.

\*SIDE NOTE: I also ordered in 2021 :p the 1st trail of it. As you can see after that it was a BIG order!

Spice and Peel has far surpassed my expectations by clearing my acne and aiding my digestion. This blend has had a profound impact on my skin and overall health, making me feel refreshed and revitalized from the inside out. It's amazing how these natural ingredients can produce such remarkable results.

TRINITY‚Äôs claim to ""obliterate anxiety, depression, and stress"" is absolutely true. Taking it in the evening has transformed my nights‚ÄîI sleep like a baby and wake up feeling incredibly positive and ready to conquer the day ‚ú®

For focus and motivation, Autonomous + Nebula is unbeatable. Taking it three times daily keeps me productive, driven, and free from negative thoughts or laziness. It‚Äôs like having a limitless day, all-natural and without side effects üí™

Since June 2019, Interstellar Blends have transformed my life. Struggling with severe depression and cognitive issues, I reached out to Gavin, who suggested the Seven Sages and Trinity blends. Skeptical but desperate, I tried them due to the money-back guarantee.

Amazingly, by the third day, my depression and anxiety were gone. After 22 years of trying various treatments, nothing worked as quickly or effectively. These blends not only lifted my depression but also improved my memory and overall brain function.

I used to struggle with completing tasks and had disorganized thoughts. Now, I can easily finish tasks and think clearly. Encouraged by Gavin, I completed a 66/6 challenge, losing 32 lbs in 12 days. I also won blends that I now use daily.

I feel and look younger, have avoided COVID, corrected heartburn, maintained my weight loss, and healed skin issues. I am a loyal customer; my last order (65904) was placed on 5/9/24. I am deeply grateful to Gavin and Interstellar Blends for giving me my life back!",2024-07-25 02:38:28,24,0,0.6226,1,1,1.0

**My name is Arielle Star. I‚Äôve been taking Interstellar Blends for almost 18 months now. I am a real customer who takes multiple Blends several time a day. This is a real, honest review written 7/24/24.**  
  
**I first started Interstellar Blends to address long covid symptoms I‚Äôd struggled with for over a year. Extreme fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, hair loss, etc‚Ä¶. Just an overall feeling of dramatic aging, tiredness and depression.**  
  
**Supernova became my favorite Blend for energy and clear headedness, without feeling stimulated of jacked up. Just pure, healthy support for energy, stamina, and feeling full of life force again.**  
  
**I also took Super Hair tonic. My hair grew back thick and fast, and less grey!!!! In the last year and half I‚Äôve taken two full 100 gram packages of Super hair, and my hair is long, thick, wavy and glorious again!!!!**  
  
**I also take Victorious, Peel and Spice daily for protection from viruses, and for epic anti-inflammatory support. I love this combo and haven‚Äôt been sick at all since starting it in March of 2023.**  
  
**Niagra is another favorite I take daily. As a 54 year old woman, it keeps my hormones and intimate functions healthy and active. I love it!**  
  
**Trinity is another daily must in our household. Great for stabilizing mood and emotions and just over all feeling good.**  
  
**Two months ago I began taking ACB (Anti Cancer Blend) daily also, as a preventative.¬† Both my parents have had aggressive cancers, so I thought it smart to add this. A weird large brown growth/mole on my temple area of my face, right along my hair line, is almost gone. It‚Äôs been there for over 5 years, slowly growing to about the size of a dime or nickel. After 2 months of ACB, its 80% diminished. Pretty excited about this!!!!!**  
  
**I‚Äôve tried and LOVE many of the other blends too! Apigenin is an absolute favorite. I don‚Äôt even know why exactly, I just LOVE how it feels when I take it daily. The new blend, Occular also is epic. I went through a sample package and my eyes felt wayyyy less strain, and my blood felt cleaner, clearer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to try Spaceborn!!!!**¬†  
  
**Interstellar Blends are complex healing super foods. They each have multiple positive effects on the body. It‚Äôs fun to feel the physical, emotional, mental and even spiritual effects these potent medicines deliver. Many of my friends and family are also enjoying the miraculous benefits of these precious super concentrated medicinal herbal blends. I could go on and on, but I‚Äôll stop here, for now‚Ä¶. Explore the website, get some samples, message Gavin (the founder/creator of Interstellar Blends), and just get these Blends into your body. You will NOT regret it.**

 I am a real customer, this is my last order #69039 from 7/8/2024  date. I have been using Interstellar blends for 10 years.  I am a health coach and personal trainer.  I have access to tons of supplements and companies asking me to promote their product.  I have extremely skeptical of any product in todays world.  



I know that interstellar blends have saved my life. literally.  I have only half a pancreas and no gallbladder due to a cancer scare.  It did turn out that I did not have cancer. I believe because I had been taking the blends prior.  I can't prove it, but I do know it was flooding my body for a few years prior.



Since my surgery, I have trouble with absorption issues.  I have pass food quickly, so getting the nutrients I need to be healthy depends on micronutrition  daily.  Meaning that I need tons for plants to flood my body.



I am 62 years old and work as a personal trainer and the blends have been amazing to help me with muscle strenght and muscle gain,  It also has been my solution for my menopause,  I have had sucess with managing my menopause.  



I have nothing but amazing things to say about the results with the blends.  I also love the customer service, from the owners, to the amazing staff.  



Anytime I have needed questions answered, or support,   Gavin and Kristine have been amazing.  They also continually encourage and empower me to be a better version of myself.  



I have worked with a lot of companies as a coach and trainer,  Interstellar Blends, has the best customer service I have ever had.





I can absolutely attest that..... they are the best product on the market to target any health issue.

Out of all the blends in the Interstellar catalog ( all are great ) this blend doubles as Neuro-protective and also as Neuro-enhancing since all these ingredients work synergistically in a way that other nootropic products currently on the market today do not.¬† The amount of research that has gone into creating it. With all the medically / clinically well-researched ingredients, it indicates clearly this was devised from the astute mind of an individual who is well-read on all the aspects of alternative and medical research studies.¬†

Do you need an edge when it comes to taking tests / creative tasks requiring great mental fortitude?¬† Then AUTONOMOUS is what I have used personally to ace several civil engineering tests that all required much logical, mathematical, and mechanical reasoning.¬† Some of us find it very hard to turn potentiality into actuality and to manifest one‚Äôs will into the world.¬† And for such a reason alone AUTONOMOUS¬†will always be part of my daily personal stack.¬†

Moreover, as a musician/ composer, it has helped me to finish projects that ordinarily I would have found WAY too complex and boring even to attempt.¬† Using this one blend alone has enriched my ‚Äú inner life ‚Äú so to speak in more ways than one.¬† Giving me a newfound sense of creativity, that can only come from a place of authentic self-expression.¬†",2024-07-24 21:16:45,19,0,0.9326,1,1,1.0

I am a satisfied, real customer of Interstellar Blends. My most recent order #67120 was made on May 27, 2024. These blends last a long time! I love them and am excited to order more.  
  
I currently use Rewire, Trinity, ACB, Spice and Peel daily - they are the first thing I put into my body in the morning. I just add them to hot water and personally, love the taste. A bit bitter. Real medicine for the body and mind.  
  
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2024 and these blends have been an instrumental part of my natural recovery, along with other healthy lifestyle choices such as nutrition and exercise. These blends help me feel energetic and clear-minded. The morning blend routine gets me through the day, but I will sometimes take them 2-3 times a day when I need an extra boost.  
  
These blends are the real deal. The company owner responds very quickly and personally to any inquiries you may have, and there is an incredible amount of research and information available on the website to educate oneself. I am so grateful!",2024-07-24 20:48:52,18,0,0.9725,1,1,1.0

12246,Interstellar_Blends,"Diverse amount of Blends and herbs designed to assist as stated with Amazing Potency

I have placed several orders from Interstellar  most recent being - Order #39733 from late last year and I can assure you the herbs are indeed as mentioned and work on a subtle yet palpable manner.  The owner is knowledgeable, helpful and active online and he walks it like he talks it.  He is in great shape, youthful and an amazing creative person and musician.  There are many avant garde blends and new formulas that address many of the barren and unchecked issues many of us face living in the modern world and they work very nicely and not harshly so works better in long run  rather than harsh rx drugs. His products and shipping prices are reasonable and he will work with you to get your goals accomplished with even certain groups for weight loss  etc.  A very sincere and transparent guy whom I appreciate.

My favorite is paraslayer and I take it with grapefruit juice.  The bitterness and ingredient list is the first and one of a kind.  The effects are second to none.  Works great for critters or mold.  Also helps me to balance my liver  from years of too much fructose.  It helps to also take the spaceborn  mushroom blend here  or do enemas to really flush out the amoebas  etc.  Most other herbal concoctions in ref to this fall short and really just have only basics such as black walnut, pumpkin seeds, wormwood  etc.  This one is ultimate super charged formula with a long list of natural herbs and plants to assist.

My 2nd favorite is jing force and it helps to mainly tone the kidneys and adrenals - something everyone needs nowadays.  High cortisol can wreck havoc and this is the only blend that I have tried  that allows me to not get bloated  even when fasting or upon waking up.  It also helps me to have steady energy throughout the day as I am not a caffeine nor coffee person and I like it better than herbs like rhodiola and similar.

The herbs come in nice resealable bags and bpa free and the paraslayer one is a nice lime green and other blends just as colorful with nice stickers to boot  if aesthetics are your thing and often a shaker bottle or similar can be obtained for free if certain order amount and similar gifts.  I highly recommend Interstellar Blends on FB and the website for perusing and  purchasing.

Order # 67288 6/3/2024
Interstallar blends saved my life after brain surgery!!! 

October 2022 I underwent the pinacle of brain surgery, having a meningioma removed from my brain stem. My spinal cord was almost completely pinched off from the tumor. I had been having headaches from hell and numbness in my limbs.. Went to a Dr and told them I was pretty sure I had a tumor and pointed to where. He dismissed it as tension headaches, 'common to women' and tried to throw steroids and muscle relaxers at me.. Fast forward a few months.. After 2 nights of no sleep and entire body clenched from the pain I went to the ER. They rushed me for tests, discovered the tumor and scheduled surgery for the next day.. The operation went perfect and I was on cloud 9 just to be alive for 1 month, I honestly wondered if they had knicked something and left me a little special because the vibrancy of life was beautifully overwhelming.. so many humble happy tears..  until one day it was like a dark cloud crashed on me and I all of a sudden had overwhelming anxiety and depression and those tears turned to hopelessness...   For months I resisted using pharma to treat the symptoms of a TBI from surgery. It was so tempting and I almost caved but I didn't... I couldn't leave my bed without being overwhelmed with a wave of anxiety and overwhelm trying to take me out and would run back to fetal position, pray for help and try to replace each rancid thought.. I'd try to get up again and catch up but I just couldn't no matter how hard I tried. I closed out the world, sent my children away with family... it was pure hell.. 

I discovered Gavins blends and my hope was peaked while reading the testimonials, so I reached out for recommendations and was told to try Trinity and Rewire. I am forever grateful to God and Gavin for these blends as my anxiety lessened, I started to feel more like myself again. The depression and darkness loosened it's grip gradually until 1 day it was just not there anymore. It'd been a struggle financially to catch back up and so there were a few months that I couldn't afford the blends. The anxiety and overwhelm came back with a vengeance and I knew I had to fight through to somehow get more blends asap. My body was crying out for them. Within a couple days of starting the blends back up I was back to good, and the anxiety and depression were replaced with calm gratitude and steady focus. Before, it was like my thought process would just evaporate or fall off a cliff and I'd have zero recollection of conversations or my points, that all stopped with the blends.  Amazing! I went from hanging on by a thread to having clarity peace and joy again!
 
I also used Gavins 'Sabertooth' for tooth and gum pain that had became pretty consistent. I made a toothpaste and also took it. I have had ZERO pain in my teeth or gums since that 1 sample ... 

I am forever grateful for these blends and the powerful natural medicinals contained therein. I am so grateful for Gavin for seeing it through and also to those who left their testimonials!

Honestly my review for this blend kinda writes itself! I had been on Plush loading dose for only 9 days when I walked in to see my hair stylist and she immediately noticed that my skin was glowing -- even though I had a mask on, haha. She immediately asked me what I was doing and I knew it was the work of this magical blend. I had definitely begun to notice some subtle differences myself, but getting that validation from someone else who had no idea about it and so early on in the process was mindblowing.

Plush has a way of brightening and smoothing your complexion in a way that's hard to describe until you experience it. You can also tell a difference in skin texture after being on it for the loading dose period, and it usually doesn't take the full 2-3 weeks to start seeing noticeable results. 

I am 34 and have never done any cosmetic surgeries, injectables, etc. -- it's really important to me to maintain my beauty from a holistic and natural place. I'm already several years into an organic/biodynamic skincare regimen, so it has been exciting to find an herbal supplement that I can compliment that with to work on my beauty from the inside.

This blend absolutely blows any nootropic out of the water with what it can do in regard to brain fog, prolonged studying, alertness, reaction time, etc. This is a formula that one will notice effects from as soon as it is utilized, whether if it is used in conjunction with challenging brain tasks or not. The effects can be felt all day without any unpleasant side effects.

Any brain task will not only become much easier, but the results that are produced when put in use in any challenging obstacle will be of far greater quality. Test it out on any assignment you have with and without using this blend and it is a night and day difference. Not incorporating this into your daily tasks will put you at a decided disadvantage. After realizing what can be accomplished with this formula, you won't ever want to go without it.

I've been using this blend for years I have not had any tolerance build up to it and I definitely notice the difference if I stop taking it. This is a formula you always want to be stocked up on if you want to skyrocket your performance. Dont take my word for it, try it out for yourself and youll come to the same conclusions that I have.",2024-07-29 02:23:55,29,0,0.5736,1,1,1.0

Now, it feels almost effortless. The blends keep me feeling satisfied and energized throughout my fasting periods, making the process so much easier. It's not just about curbing hunger, it's about feeling genuinely good while doing it.

I am a real customer who has used these blends since 2015. My first was the original blend that Gavin developed. Over the years I have tried many and my personal favorite is Trinity. I love how balanced it makes me feel. A little under 2 years ago I was in an automobile accident and fractured my left clavicle and ankle. I immediately ordered and started using Titanium to support bone healing. I also experienced weight loss specifically muscle loss after the accident and have been using and loving Gainz. Before Gainz I was at 117# I could not gain weight (My ideal weight is 127-130#) It took a while and today I weight in at 127 and I have developed muscle strength again. 2 more wins came from Ocular, my vision has improved since using it and Sabre Tooth. Last dental cleaning was the best in a long time! I am about to place a new order as I am running low. Because I believe in these blends I have referred many friends and coaching clients to Gavin and his team.

Started giving the blends to my sister who was experiencing severe depression last summer.  After taking rewire and spaceborn consistently, she ended up going to her first boxing class. Keep in mind, she had not been to the gym since this past January. Also, the boxing class I go to isn‚Äôt the easiest. It was very relieving to see her take this pathway, and notice improvement in her life. 

For me - I am a survivor of SA and this has opened up a lot of dark gateways in my life previously (toxic relationships, heavy drinking and smoking from 13-29 years old, etc etc etc) after a lot of self analysis - Got the sign to give up the numbing factors in my life at 29.  I am now 36 - and was mysteriously guided to the blends in 2022. My favorite blends where I noticed a pretty deep shift: Nebula, Spaceborn, Rewire, and Autonomous 

As a result of taking Nebula specifically -  I feel I was able to get a new lease on life again. Was interviewing for remote sales positions and landed within the first week. Learning and growing a lot on this journey  and feeling like I‚Äôm shifting into a new time line. Feeling a lot more relaxed in my body. It‚Äôs been a process but I am happy to be in a community that understands. Although it‚Äôs been a rocky past, the entrepreneurial, trading and sales realm seems to have embraced me with open arms.

     I have tried many Interstellar Blends for mind and body. For the mind I have tried Nebula, Rewire, Trinity & Apigenin. For the body I have tried Plush & Super Tonic Hair. While all of these blends work great and have served their purpose I have found the most benefit from Autonomous & Heavy Metal Detox. 
     I have been diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage years & was never a fan of stimulant medication. Not only does it make me feel anxious but it also dampens my creativity. I work in the sound and music industry so taking my stimulant medication has a negative effect on my work. Autonomous has helped me have the initiative I need to start & finish my work while also maintaining my natural creativity. 
     I have had deep lines under my eyes & on my hands since childhood. I did more research & learned that this could be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. I decided to try the Heavy Metal Detox formula & it was definitely the answer to my problem. I feel like I have aged backwards! My hands look a lot healthier & the deep lines under my eyes have become more refined. I hope more people will try the Heavy Metal Detox formula as many Americans are exposed to heavy metals on a daily basis.

**Trinity** is the singular blend has fixed more issues for more people than I can count. The FB posts about this blend from people are just incredible! If you have a health or body/mind issue, then it‚Äôs very likely that this blend will drastically improve it. If you‚Äôre unsure, then send a message and ask! They‚Äôre very responsive and take customer service seriously.  
This is the highest quality most comprehensive herbal blend on the planet (except for Seven Sages which is still in beta). If you try just one blend this is the one to start with!  
No matter how bad a bad day is, it turns into a good day with Trinity. Just 1/8 to 1/4 tsp a day is plenty for most. Helps me to feel calm, clear, buoyant, naturally joyful and light, helps remove those feelings of depression, doom and gloom, where the world is caving in on you.  
Tired of life? Every day pretty much sucks? Can‚Äôt think, can‚Äôt focus, tired all the time, can‚Äôt do family time at home or perform on the job anymore? Just wanna get away from everybody and be alone so you can sulk and eat ice cream and watch movies? Then get Trinity and feel joyful and young again! I take Trinity with Thermogenesis everyday, and add Pine Pollen with Supernova or the Original Blend on those days when I really need to rock and roll. Face wrinkles and skin issues are lessening. I look younger and have that inner glow again. No more sallow, tired, wrinkled, energyless, lifeless, deadbeat zombie face anymore. How many people out there look like zombies to you? Like they would rather curl up and die than live? Half if not most? Are you one of them? Tired of it? Then invest in yourself and buy these blends and get the show on the road! These herbal blends combined with 22/2 or 21/3 intermittent fasting are the most valuable life and health improvement tools I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôve been taking these blends for over a year and doing intermittent fasting for a month and it‚Äôs the best health change I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs anti-cancer too! So stop dilly dallying and just do it! (I‚Äôm not a salesmen and have never made a dime from these blends, and don‚Äôt want to!)

In doing my research on parasite elimination I found some seriously complicated treatments! It was a no- brainer to try these two blends together for complete success . The Science is all there , the research has been done and they are blended using  organic carefully sourced ingredients !

Interstellar Blends have been a transformative addition to my family's daily routine. As a real consumer since 2019, with a last order number of 59866 from May 2024, I have experienced significant personal benefits since incorporating these blends into our lives. Personally, I have lost a substantial amount of weight with THERMO, which has not only improved my physical health but also boosted my overall confidence. The blends AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN have been instrumental in helping me focus and maintain the energy and cognitive focus needed during the entirety of my doctorate program. Their impact has extended beyond just me, proving beneficial for my entire family in various ways.

My husband has also seen remarkable improvements in his health since using Interstellar Blends. He has successfully lost weight with THERMO as well as AUTOPHAGY and, more importantly, managed to combat the constant pain caused by inflammation with ASCENDANCE. He has healed his stomach ulcers with HELICO as well. He takes SHILAJIT daily, as he is super active and needs his electrolytes replenished quickly. Additionally, he has gained better control over his temper thanks to REWIRE, leading to a more harmonious household. Our son, who began using the blends to enhance his cognitive abilities, has seen incredible results. At just 13 years old, he was able to start college, a milestone we attribute largely to the benefits of also taking AUTONOMOUS and LUTEOLIN blends. He uses PEEL and SPICE when he goes overboard at the gym and never feels sore!

The benefits of Interstellar Blends do not stop there. My 100-year-old grandmother uses THROM to dissolve a blood clot and LUNG POWER for her COPD, showcasing their wide-ranging efficacy. We all rely on these blends for overall wellness and as a preventive measure against common illnesses. In times of sickness, VICTORIOUS blend has been our go-to remedy to combat germs and promote faster recovery. Additionally, we all take TRINITY to keep our mental health in top shape, ensuring we stay balanced and mentally resilient. Our collective experience with Interstellar Blends has been overwhelmingly positive, and we wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone seeking natural, effective solutions for health and wellness.",2024-07-26 21:48:44,22,0,0.998,1,1,1.0
12314,Interstellar_Blends,"My Favorites! Wowza!

Let me review my very favorite blends. I have tried quite a few.

First, I started using Interstellar Blends over 5 years ago. I started with the Peel blend which helps with keeping blood sugars down. I used a blood glucose monitor to track my morning blood fasting levels each day to see if the blend really affected my glucose. Sure enough, a few weeks later, my readings were consistently in the 80-90 range upon waking, rather than 120. So I kept taking the Peel blend. I kind of began to crave it. A few months later, I noticed that in addition to my reduced glucose levels I was also not getting the colds and flu even when everyone else in the house got sick. Wow! Peel has remained a daily blend for me ever since.

My second blend that was life-changing was Trinity. This blend helps with anxiety. I am truly one of those adaptable, I can handle anything kind of people. Until I wasn't. With perimenopause came some real deep anxiety and strong emotions that were rough. I was crying, my hisband asking what was wrong. I would tearfully say, ""I don't know!"" I started on Trinity and a week later, no more tightness in the chest. No more tears. I went along like this for a few months and ran out of my Trinity. I had no clue how much it was helping until I DIDN'T have it. The crash of anxiety and sadness came back in a swoop until I could get more ordered and taken for a couple days. But that is the cool thing about Trinity. It doesn't dull emotions or make you feel flat like some medications. It just makes you feel like a regular person again. I will never again let myself run out of this blend.

Right now I am experimenting with a few of the newer blends that help with metabolism and weight loss. NRF-2, Trigliceride, Fatty Liver, and Ceramide are some of the blends in the mix. I've struggled with weight gain with perimenopause and decided to tackle the issue. In 2 months I have lost 21 pounds and still losing. The online community for Interstellar Blends is incredibly supportive and I am motivated to continue my weight loss journey supported by the blends.

I tell anyone who will listen how life-changing and health-supportive these blends are. I cannot recommend them more highly.

Wanted to leave this review to put on display what this legend has created.

I‚Äôm a real customer, and have been for the last 3-4 years. I‚Äôve had some truly life-changing results with the interstellar blends. When I started, this was about weight loss. I weighed over 300 lbs, and now I‚Äôm down to 220 lbs and feeling better than ever. The weight loss was natural and gradual, if I had taken it more seriously, I‚Äôd be well under 200 lbs by now, but that‚Äôs not my goal. It all began with the weight loss, but as I learned more about their products, I found myself diving into a rabbit hole of their high-quality blends. My last order was #63851, and I‚Äôve been using blends like Trinity, Victorious, Shilajit, Peel, Spice, Nebula, and Spaceborn. Each of these blends works great on its own, but together, they create a holistic approach to wellness that‚Äôs just incomparable.

Trinity has been a lifesaver for managing my stress, helping me to really excel at work which is high stress most of the time. Victorious, the anti-viral blend, kept my family and me healthy and worry-free, even when the world was in chaos. I have a few herniated discs in my neck, and the pain was unbearable. But Peel and Spice have been amazing for helping get rid of most if not alol, of the inflammation and pain. Instead of going through with surgery, I opted for physical therapy and these blends, and I haven‚Äôt looked back in three years. I‚Äôm so grateful for what Gavin has created here.

This brand offers a ton of life-changing blends, and you can see it in the countless testimonials and reviews from other customers. These products are truly your last stop for supplements.

Since June 2019, Interstellar Blends have transformed my life. Struggling with severe depression and cognitive issues, I reached out to Gavin, who suggested the Seven Sages and Trinity blends. Skeptical but desperate, I tried them due to the money-back guarantee.

Amazingly, by the third day, my depression and anxiety were gone. After 22 years of trying various treatments, nothing worked as quickly or effectively. These blends not only lifted my depression but also improved my memory and overall brain function.

After 2 months of ACB, its 80% diminished. Pretty excited about this!!!!!**

I also recently purchased Seven Sages and it has been a pleasant change! Every day it's a different blend and it helps me move throughout my days-- as a homeschooling mom to two gifted and talented children and an investor, I need all the stamina, clarity,  focus, and energy I can get! 

I would highly suggest for anyone to try a few samples. There's so many options to choose from! Believe me when I say you won't regret it!

Five years ago, I happened upon Interstellar Blends when it was tagged in a social media post about a coffee replacement that promised improved energy and focus. The response to the tag said something to the effect of the coffee alternative not even coming close to what Interstellar Blends provided, so I was instantly intrigued. The Interstellar Blends website was full of legitimate, science-backed, evidenced-based research supporting not only each blend,  but each and every blend‚Äôs ingredients. After basically a lifetime of searching for something that would help with repeated failed weight loss attempts and also wanting an escape from increasing depression, anxiety, and brain fog, I jumped into a 12 day challenge, lost 36 pounds, and never felt better physically, mentally, and emotionally. I highly recommend building a combo of blends and making use of the Interstellar website where you can select the target health issues you want to address and get recommendations for the best blends that will make you be the best version of yourself. Once you start, you will quickly find out that no other weight loss, health and wellness, or longevity product compares to what Interstellar offers. The Interstellar community also provides a place of support as well as knowledge and experience as you begin your life-changing journey with the blends. Don‚Äôt even think twice about it - just order, start, and enjoy!",2024-08-05 04:00:35,23,0,0.9503,1,1,1.0

When I found Interstellar I was so intrigued that in a span of 4 months I had made 3 orders. Then I had a good stack of blends for most situations needed.

**Trinity** is my daily staple for feeling calm and kicking stress out the door. Need help focusing? **Autonomous** to the rescue! **Thermo** and **Glucose Blocker** are (for me) a great companion for fasting. **Rewire** is on another level to help with addictions (üçÉ) and even useless, ruminating thoughts.

I have many more that I cycle through the week but those are my daily one's that keep me level.  And the best is, Gavin keeps coming up with more amazing blends! I have yet to try some of them but overall, depending of what you're looking for to help you with, you'll most probably find something!

PS. I imagine the blends been like fuel additives. Regular gas could be food and sleep, premium gas is fasting, clean sleep and good sleep, and when you add in the fuel additive (BLENDS!) all good is exponentiated!

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends' Trinity supplement for several years. Initially, it seemed expensive, but after doing thorough research and experiencing its benefits firsthand, I now see its value and will continue using it indefinitely. I took a year off during the pandemic due to financial struggles, which I now regret. Trinity has been instrumental in stabilizing my mood, eliminating severe mood swings, and improving my overall quality of life. Taking a small portion daily with my coffee has made a significant difference, and I‚Äôve even recommended it to friends.

Not only has Trinity improved my mental well-being, but it also helped me overcome addiction. The clarity it provides allowed me to realign with my true self and pursue a healthier lifestyle. The cost, just under $300 for a year's supply, equates to about a dollar a day, making it a worthwhile investment. Gavin's support through Facebook and personal texts is exceptional, adding even more value to this product.

If you struggle with mood swings, depression, or addiction, I urge you to try Trinity. It has truly changed my life. The best decision I made was starting with Trinity and getting back on it after a hiatus.

In fact I ended up with a serious Stephen Johnson Syndrome reaction with extreme burns on my face & chest from the drs recommended meds. I struggled with cardiac issues & neurological issues for years.

It felt like an internal rearrangement manifesting outward‚Äîa literal rewiring.  
  
Over the past 2 years, I‚Äôve used a variety of combos with fasting and lost all the weight and emotional baggage from the lockdowns. My most recent order (#67537) on June 7th, 2024, included 7 Sages, Autonomous, Nebula, and a Fertility sample. I go through Autonomous much quicker, so I‚Äôll be ordering double next time. Autonomous is my absolute favorite blend, with Nebula a close second for boosting my willpower. Health is a holistic journey, and these blends are a powerful tool in conjunction with diet, fasting, meditation, exercise etc. for becoming SUPERHUMAN!  
  
As a woman who goes through cycles, the Fertility blend is my favorite for nurturing my YIN and managing my cycles with ease and grace. I‚Äôve only tried one sample so far but will order more. Alongside Autonomous and Fertility, 7 Sages is becoming a new favorite, offering variety and activating different areas each day. I‚Äôve been ordering blends consistently for two years, and they‚Äôve become an integral part of my lifestyle. Along with the other modalities mentioned, I am consistently leveling up. I‚Äôve moved through four jobs, each better than the last, and finally landed my dream job, where I feel content for the long term. The drive and brainstorming wouldn‚Äôt have been as powerful without these blends. My aura is brighter, and I radiate abundance and strength. Just like water seeks its own level, keep doing the work and everything evens out.

First off I want to say that I‚Äôm a REAL customer and my last order number is #69095. I‚Äôve been taking the blends for going on two years now and I can't say enough good things about Interstellar Blends! Ever since I started taking their blends, I've felt better than I ever have before. It's like I have a new level of energy and focus that I never thought was possible. I used to feel tired and sluggish all of the time, but after doing dry fasting and taking the blends I feel incredible. These blends have seriously made a huge difference in my life!

The customer service at Interstellar Blends is spectacular. Whenever I have a question, Gavin is always quick to respond and is super helpful. He really knows his stuff and is always willing to go the extra mile to make sure I'm satisfied. It's clear that the team at Interstellar Blends genuinely cares about their customers and their well being.

Another thing I love is all of the knowledge available on their website. There's so much valuable information about the different blends and how they can benefit your health. I've learned so much just by browsing through their site, and it has helped me make better choices for my health. Overall, Interstellar Blends is amazing, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to improve their health and wellness!",2024-07-24 17:03:18,21,0,0.9967,1,1,1.0

I had to share my experience as I (almost) gave up on my own health. My testimonial is my true story of restored hope with the Interstellar blends.

I tried and had success with the blends before and felt great! Menopause, some surgeries and hip ‚Äúarthritis‚Äù where I surrendered to not exercising got me off track. Then I popped onto the Interstellar chats and was inspired and educated once again. So much support and information! August 1 - deep dive in with blends and no cheating for two weeks straight - I just finished a 50 mile bike ride in the Rocky Mountains with at hip ‚Äúarthritis‚Äù that has improved by 80%. In addition, the Super Hair Tonic has left my hair thicker and fuller than I could have imagined. And my motivation? I am focused, peaceful and ready to tackle this weight gain - I didn't realize the blends actually helped me to focus and be motivated to go for it! I‚Äôm buying the combo now and have 3 weeks of habits behind me in order to do the challenge Heidi Fire style at the end of the month! I‚Äôm 10 pounds down and 65 to go. PS: when I was 21 years old, I made the Canadian Olympic rowing team. I was a very good athlete. I blew out my knee and had to step down. I just surrendered to that injury and never got back to sports and gave up. I am now 56 and what the help of the blends and the awesome support I have realized through clarity and focus and motivation that, I am going to draw a line in the sand and go for it. Doing the impossible, but with the help of what I believe to be the greatest health support on the planet. Bravo Interstallar Team!!! ",2024-08-22 15:56:42,19,0,0.9932,1,1,1.0

Fantastic, absolutely fantastic anti-inflammatory and pain eliminators. Great stuff! Mix it in coffee or grapefruit juice. Invest in a milk frother or immersion blender to incorporate the blends in your drink. 


**For women with horrible periods: take 1 tablespoon 2x/day (morning and night) for 3 days before your cycle and and every day of your cycle. You'll be amazed at the difference you feel and look. It eliminates all bloating and greatly reduces dependency on pain relivers like ibuprofen. It also curbs sugar cravings.

 I am a real customer, this is my last order #69039 from 7/8/2024  date. I have been using Interstellar blends for 10 years.  I am a health coach and personal trainer.  I have access to tons of supplements and companies asking me to promote their product.  I have extremely skeptical of any product in todays world.  



I know that interstellar blends have saved my life. literally.  I have only half a pancreas and no gallbladder due to a cancer scare.  It did turn out that I did not have cancer. I believe because I had been taking the blends prior.  I can't prove it, but I do know it was flooding my body for a few years prior.



Since my surgery, I have trouble with absorption issues.  I have pass food quickly, so getting the nutrients I need to be healthy depends on micronutrition  daily.  Meaning that I need tons for plants to flood my body.



I am 62 years old and work as a personal trainer and the blends have been amazing to help me with muscle strenght and muscle gain,  It also has been my solution for my menopause,  I have had sucess with managing my menopause.  



I have nothing but amazing things to say about the results with the blends.  I also love the customer service, from the owners, to the amazing staff.  



Anytime I have needed questions answered, or support,   Gavin and Kristine have been amazing.  They also continually encourage and empower me to be a better version of myself.  



I have worked with a lot of companies as a coach and trainer,  Interstellar Blends, has the best customer service I have ever had.





I can absolutely attest that..... they are the best product on the market to target any health issue.

I can attest that as a real customer having ordered a few blends from Interstellar over the last couple years,¬† my most recent order ([#66201 ](https://theinterstellarplan.com/my-account/view-order/66201/))¬† was placed on May 12, 2024,¬† in which I ordered my absolute bespoke blend AUTONOMOUS along with some Samples. Out of all the blends in the Interstellar catalog ( all are great ) this blend doubles as Neuro-protective and also as Neuro-enhancing since all these ingredients work synergistically in a way that other nootropic products currently on the market today do not.¬† The amount of research that has gone into creating it. With all the medically / clinically well-researched ingredients, it indicates clearly this was devised from the astute mind of an individual who is well-read on all the aspects of alternative and medical research studies.¬†

Do you need an edge when it comes to taking tests / creative tasks requiring great mental fortitude?¬† Then AUTONOMOUS is what I have used personally to ace several civil engineering tests that all required much logical, mathematical, and mechanical reasoning.¬† Some of us find it very hard to turn potentiality into actuality and to manifest one‚Äôs will into the world.¬† And for such a reason alone AUTONOMOUS¬†will always be part of my daily personal stack.¬†

Moreover, as a musician/ composer, it has helped me to finish projects that ordinarily I would have found WAY too complex and boring even to attempt.¬† Using this one blend alone has enriched my ‚Äú inner life ‚Äú so to speak in more ways than one.¬† Giving me a newfound sense of creativity, that can only come from a place of authentic self-expression.¬†",2024-07-24 21:16:45,19,0,0.9326,1,1,1.0

Order # 67288 6/3/2024
Interstallar blends saved my life after brain surgery!!! 

October 2022 I underwent the pinacle of brain surgery, having a meningioma removed from my brain stem. My spinal cord was almost completely pinched off from the tumor. I had been having headaches from hell and numbness in my limbs.. Went to a Dr and told them I was pretty sure I had a tumor and pointed to where. He dismissed it as tension headaches, 'common to women' and tried to throw steroids and muscle relaxers at me.. Fast forward a few months.. After 2 nights of no sleep and entire body clenched from the pain I went to the ER. They rushed me for tests, discovered the tumor and scheduled surgery for the next day.. The operation went perfect and I was on cloud 9 just to be alive for 1 month, I honestly wondered if they had knicked something and left me a little special because the vibrancy of life was beautifully overwhelming.. so many humble happy tears..  until one day it was like a dark cloud crashed on me and I all of a sudden had overwhelming anxiety and depression and those tears turned to hopelessness...   For months I resisted using pharma to treat the symptoms of a TBI from surgery. It was so tempting and I almost caved but I didn't... I couldn't leave my bed without being overwhelmed with a wave of anxiety and overwhelm trying to take me out and would run back to fetal position, pray for help and try to replace each rancid thought.. I'd try to get up again and catch up but I just couldn't no matter how hard I tried. I closed out the world, sent my children away with family... it was pure hell.. 

I discovered Gavins blends and my hope was peaked while reading the testimonials, so I reached out for recommendations and was told to try Trinity and Rewire. I am forever grateful to God and Gavin for these blends as my anxiety lessened, I started to feel more like myself again. The depression and darkness loosened it's grip gradually until 1 day it was just not there anymore. It'd been a struggle financially to catch back up and so there were a few months that I couldn't afford the blends. The anxiety and overwhelm came back with a vengeance and I knew I had to fight through to somehow get more blends asap. My body was crying out for them. Within a couple days of starting the blends back up I was back to good, and the anxiety and depression were replaced with calm gratitude and steady focus. Before, it was like my thought process would just evaporate or fall off a cliff and I'd have zero recollection of conversations or my points, that all stopped with the blends.  Amazing! I went from hanging on by a thread to having clarity peace and joy again!
 
I also used Gavins 'Sabertooth' for tooth and gum pain that had became pretty consistent. I made a toothpaste and also took it. I have had ZERO pain in my teeth or gums since that 1 sample ... 

I am forever grateful for these blends and the powerful natural medicinals contained therein. I am so grateful for Gavin for seeing it through and also to those who left their testimonials! 
God bless you Gavin! ",2024-07-24 14:22:22,18,0,0.984,1,1,1.0
12396,Interstellar_Blends,"Top quality!!!

So, came across this site along my journey, and was recommended to check out the blends. This was exactly what I was searching for. Herbal blends to aid my daily life (exercising, dieting, meditating, etc, etc), as I believe unfortunately we are unable to get all the goodness from foods alone in this day in age.

¬†I am a real person, not an AI bot or similar, I am not perfect, and do go through my fair share of struggles. This is a true review and testimonial.

¬†I have ordered a few times but one of my last orders was in April 2024 - #63876. I stocked up for the year. The blends are mixed with my morning coffee, and not only does the caffeine wake me up, but the herbal blends also fire up the correct receptors and I have no brain fog at all. I am able to focus in and get on with my day at work, no stopping fir umming and rrring, I am straight there and straight up with the answers. My brain loves the stuff.

¬†Not only for my brain but also for my body, my body feels good and can feel my digestion is a lot better. Once the digestion was sorted it helped me in other areas of my life. I am not as tired during the day, no more afternoon naps. I also have enough energy to hit the gym in a fasted state.

¬†All my blends are consumed in the morning whilst in a fasted state and I take with coffee. You can take it with matcha tea as well if you like.

¬†On another note, I also tried a newer blend ""Rewire"". I ordered this initially to aid me wean of certain substances which I should not have been taking. Not only did it help with my cravings, I felt it also helped me sleep at night (which was always an issue in the past when trying to quit). I finished the pack and never felt better. I wish I found these blends a decade ago.

¬†I highly recommend trying some of the blends, have a look on the website, there will something for everyone. We do not get the nutrients in the foods as we did 50 years ago, and with ultra processed foods which has swamped our markets everything little bit helps, and we should all find something to aid our daily living, along with the right diet and exercise.

¬†Give these guys a go, you won't regret it. I have ordered several times and will continue to order into my old age.",2024-08-28 09:27:11,18,0,0.9901,1,1,1.0

12399,Interstellar_Blends,"My Dryfasting Journey

I started dryfasting 2018 when I heard of it from the snake diet guy, later on I discovered the page dryfasting.com which lead me even deeper into the journey and provided very elaborate and scientifically backed information about dry fasting and it is when I first read about how herbal blends can support fasting and be combined with drytasting, where the effects of herbs are potentiated after dryfasts and they make fasting easier especially for overweight people.
After buying my first blends I could feel some distinct effects like restructuring in my spine, more energy, that I never felt from herbs like that before. I bought many herbal products, but these blends gave me the best results. I would say they are really close to giving you the maximum benefit you can reap from herbal products.
Later on I stumbled over the masterfastsystem, which gave me great relieve of symptoms and progress on my health journey in many ways and it helped me pull out a lot of mucoid plaque and all kinds of other nasty things, but since I have quite low bodyfat the masterfastsystem wasn't always suitable for me anymore because it pulled too much on my reserves over the years. Moreover I have concerns that it could age you too quickly, but it really helps me a lot if I do it sporadically.

So then I decided to buy a big stock of interstellarblends for the first time in 2022 to support me with fasting because I was sure I could trust that they give me a great effect. Without these blends I couldn't have done the first semester of my masters study (due to my health), I can feel them helping me in many ways, my collarbone, spine and skeleton shifted, my seasonal allergies improved, I could tolerate coffee with them again (I stopped drinking it though, cause I have nervous issues and I'm sensitive to them, they really help me to function in everyday life, I can feel my nervous system symptoms less (I have multiple sclerosis) even though I still am in a battle with my health issues, which is a great gift to me and is the reason why I became obsessed with the blends and would recommend them to all people who want to perform better, fast easier, live longer, but mainly to the sick people to make your everyday life quite a bit easier.

My goal now is to work myself up to longer dryfasts without depleting myself too much of nutrients. So the plan is that I try to get to the 3 day dryfasting mark (which is hard for me cause I'm an ectomorph, plus with certain health problems it can be harder) again as I have done in the past and in between refuel with healthy food and take the blends (which then are more effective after a longer dryfast) and then maybe after 2-3 weeks try my next long dryfast. I hope I can heal further by following this plan.",2024-08-02 10:28:19,18,0,0.9975,1,1,1.0

I am a satisfied, real customer of Interstellar Blends. My most recent order #67120 was made on May 27, 2024. These blends last a long time! I love them and am excited to order more.  
  
I currently use Rewire, Trinity, ACB, Spice and Peel daily - they are the first thing I put into my body in the morning. I just add them to hot water and personally, love the taste. A bit bitter. Real medicine for the body and mind.  
  
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2024 and these blends have been an instrumental part of my natural recovery, along with other healthy lifestyle choices such as nutrition and exercise. These blends help me feel energetic and clear-minded. The morning blend routine gets me through the day, but I will sometimes take them 2-3 times a day when I need an extra boost.

12405,Interstellar_Blends,"I wanted to repost my review from trustpilot because I spent quite some time writing it, and I want it to be here as well: The Truth about Interstellar Blends and Gavin (personal experience)

I have been on this journey with Gavin since 2020 and his blends absolutely changed my life.



I found him through the trading community where some buddies of mine recommended me his Trinity and Nebula for trading. And boy did it make a difference.



I wanted my parents to get me some of his blends, and upon inspection that my father did, he said that Gavin must be a scammer for there is no such thing as perfect reviews. So they didn't buy the blends for me. 



But I trusted my trading buddies and wanted to at least give the man a shot to see if it makes a difference. 



I had to save up for a few months to get that $600 extra cash for 2 big bags of blends. And I was praying that it will work since it was hard back then for me to get my hands on that much money. 



After the two bags of Nebula and Trinity arrived, in 3 days of fasting + blends genuinely eliminated my anxiety, depression and tension, and completely restructured my presence. I had severe ADHD and 1/4 of tsp of Trinity and Nebula made me present, here and now.



3 months later I had my first profitable trading month in Forex.



NOTE: its not the blends that make you successful, but they are the key to easier achievement.



I could never trade and study 16h per day everyday for 3 months and put in the work without the blends. 



And if you think that is amazing, it was just the beginning. After hitting my first 10k month at age of 19, I got myself a shit ton of blends, and later down the line when his list of blends expanded, I am buying minimum of 15 different blends every single time...



Not only that, but I also had epilepsy, and I started to reject the poisonous pills that doctors gave me which had literally infinite negatives and only one potential positive.



With Alz, Lutein, Apigenin I have not had any more seizures, tho I believe there is more to it than blends. Gavin also got me on ketogenic diet, 22/2 fasting, one 3 day dry fast per quarter and one 3 day dry + 3 day water per year. 



I have studied epilepsy and seizures and made a huge leap for myself, 6 years seizure free and got my drivers license now. Thanks to blends, diet, lifestyle changes and mindset - I also helped a few others do the same... 



In the other review I forgot to mention that I am adrenaline addict and I do a lot of extreme sports. Nebula, Autonomous, Trinity, Rewire and Anti-Fatigue have helped me push the limits of the sports I am in, and I also gave the blends to my friends who went nuts for them. 



The blends work like a charm. But they are not magic. If you think you can drink alcohol, eat junk food, watch adult content and scroll social media and have the blends cope for all the negatives, you are mistaken. Blends are enhancers, boosters, rewards for correct behavior, not magic pill. Do your part and the blends will do theirs.



Needless to say Gavin's Interstellar Blends are a big part of my life for the past 4 years, and will continue to be.



For anyone thinking that his products are too expensive I say: Find me someone who offers even remotely close products and also ask yourself, how bad is your mindset that you are putting a price on your well-being and health....



If anyone has any doubts about what I wrote reach out to me, if you have any questions reach out, anything at all, just reach out, I am willing to help and give you a live testimony with more depth and more instructions. (Telegram, twitter, instagram, whatever, look up my name or handle u/giustix369, will vouch for Gavin any day!)



I already went on for too long, but you would as well if something literally changed your life and you see people hating on the guy that is helping thousands become self-actualized. Gavin answers questions, helps you out in DM's if you just ask. 



But yes it is true, HE WILL NOT TOLLERATE WEAK EXCUSE MAKING PEOPLE. 



Here in the Interstellar Blends community we strive to be excellent, to make the best version of ourselves and not compromise with anything. We break limits, we move mountains and we work together. 



Super community, super Gavin, super us!

I have placed several orders from Interstellar  most recent being - Order #39733 from late last year and I can assure you the herbs are indeed as mentioned and work on a subtle yet palpable manner.  The owner is knowledgeable, helpful and active online and he walks it like he talks it.  He is in great shape, youthful and an amazing creative person and musician.  There are many avant garde blends and new formulas that address many of the barren and unchecked issues many of us face living in the modern world and they work very nicely and not harshly so works better in long run  rather than harsh rx drugs. His products and shipping prices are reasonable and he will work with you to get your goals accomplished with even certain groups for weight loss  etc.  A very sincere and transparent guy whom I appreciate.

My favorite is paraslayer and I take it with grapefruit juice.  The bitterness and ingredient list is the first and one of a kind.  The effects are second to none.  Works great for critters or mold.  Also helps me to balance my liver  from years of too much fructose.  It helps to also take the spaceborn  mushroom blend here  or do enemas to really flush out the amoebas  etc.  Most other herbal concoctions in ref to this fall short and really just have only basics such as black walnut, pumpkin seeds, wormwood  etc.  This one is ultimate super charged formula with a long list of natural herbs and plants to assist.

My 2nd favorite is jing force and it helps to mainly tone the kidneys and adrenals - something everyone needs nowadays.  High cortisol can wreck havoc and this is the only blend that I have tried  that allows me to not get bloated  even when fasting or upon waking up.  It also helps me to have steady energy throughout the day as I am not a caffeine nor coffee person and I like it better than herbs like rhodiola and similar.

The herbs come in nice resealable bags and bpa free and the paraslayer one is a nice lime green and other blends just as colorful with nice stickers to boot  if aesthetics are your thing and often a shaker bottle or similar can be obtained for free if certain order amount and similar gifts.  I highly recommend Interstellar Blends on FB and the website for perusing and  purchasing.

I have lost 4 lbs. and now it is not so painful to go up and down the stairs since I live on the 3rd floor, my energy has improved as well as my focus. I am able to fast from 7pm to noon the following day with no issues and this was something I never thought possible since I was a junk food lover ¬†and being Latin American where all we eat is carbs has not made it easy. I plan to stick to this protocol ¬†and get the weight and my health to where it should be. I have two young kids and need all the energy I can get.¬†

The blend will make miracles but you need to be willing to put some work like walking and eating healthy to help you lose weight faster and stopped being a couch potato.

My sister-in-law told me about these blends and I was very skeptical and thought it was too good to be true . Boy was I wrong!
These blends are a gamechanger! I'm a 52 yearvpld teacher going through menopause and Trinity has literally saved my marriage! LOL. All kidding aside, this blend really helps with mood swings and depression.

I am a real customer. My last order number is #66268 on May 12, 2024. 

My favorite blends are Autonomous and Rewire, which guarantee incredible relief from stress, if you are someone who has a lot of stress during the day, these 2 blends will help you a lot. Another favorite blend is Purge, if you want to feel like a new person, this blend is something incredible and indescribable. (you really feel better after it!!!)

If you want to feel unstoppable and have an incredible amount of energy, then Supernova or Nebula is what will help you tremendously.

If you think that blends are expensive, think about how much you spend per month on alcohol, drugs or junk food and then you will realize that they are not expensive at all and last a really long time. 

I recommend them to everyone who wants to take their health to the next level.  Thank you Interstellar!

I started using Blends about 1 years ago for a short period of time (4weeks). I didn‚Äôt follow any particular fasting routine and no particular diet. Therefore, I noticed slight changes in my mood and ways of thinking. I only used Trinity twice a day, fast forward 6 months I decided to give it another go this time adding Nebula and Autonomous with Trinity and took them all separately twice a day while following a strict 22-2 fast routine after cleansing myself with a 72hr fast. HOLY. SHIT. The results came much faster than I expected. I felt so amazing every day it was almost breathtaking how good I was feeling day in and day out. Before I struggled with mental health issues‚Ä¶. And what was strange I was doing very similar things as when I struggled with my mental health. The difference was now I was fasting and taking the blends. I just felt so much more energetic, calm, loving and outgoing.

12420,Interstellar_Blends,"NATURE‚ÄôS SUPERPOWER

This is a testimonial to confirm that I am a legitimate and returning customer of the Interstellar Blends \[Last order #68857 on 6/6/2024\] and have been taking them daily for the past four years.

Interstellar was introduced to me by my son, after I have been treating post op breast cancer in 2017/18 without any chemo, radiotherapy or hormone pills, and was researching and trying various natural alternatives, such as detox, fasting, change of diet, Rick Simpson Oil, essential oils, medicinal mushrooms, vitamins and supplements. I was making good progress, but with the blends, it took me to another level, both physically and mentally!!

Started with the full arsenal: 7 Sages, ACB, Senolitic, Luteolin, Autophagy, Peel, Spice, Glucose Blocker, Trinity, Autonomous, Victorious, Paraslayer, Shilajit and Matcha. Combined with regular intermittent fasting and mostly paleo diet, my health improved exponentially. I also felt much less anxious about the future, and Gavin‚Äôs expert advice, whenever I had a question, was really helpful.

Since then I also cycled various other blends: Nebula, Jing Force, Purge, Hypnotic, Anti-adipogenic, Thermo, Superhair, Plush, Rewire, Spaceborn and my health continued to improve. During that time I most incredibly managed to stop vaping Cannabis, which I had been using for stress and back pain and couldn‚Äôt imagine going without. Now I don‚Äôt miss it at all!

Most recently I added Titanium, Gainz, Sabretooth, Ocular, Anti-fatigue, NRF2 and GLP-1 activator in the mix, as I am getting older and accidentally broke my arm. My physiotherapist was seriously impressed with the speedy recovery, especially the fast return to my normal strength, even though I‚Äôm not very keen on the resistance or weights exercising. I prefer gardening and dogwalking.

On top of all these personal benefits, our 13y old Bulldog cross Staffie, who had two surgeries to remove mast cell tumours, at 10y & 12y, is now also on daily blends (ACB, Senolytic, Peel, Spice and Shilajit) and still going strong, running around the local parks and fields and enjoying life. Her new nickname is Indestructible.

In short, these blends helped me thrive following a cancer battle, effortlessly kick long term Cannabis addiction, vastly improve my mental health and heal a spiral fracture of the Humerus in record time. My son also benefited in numerous ways, the latest example being that he regrew part of his his gum with Sabretooth, but I will let him write his own review.

So I can attest that as a family, we are very real and regular customers of Interstellar! Coffee and blends in the morning has become a firm ritual to start of every day. At 55 I am much healthier and in better mental state than I was ten years ago. My next project is to utilise the blends to build muscle, increase fitness, immunity and brain power, to carry me strong and happy into the autumn of my life.

Since I started drinking these incredible blends my memory is much better, my addiction to food is at its lowest ever, even when I have a ""cheat"" day and dont fast, I can eat breakfast at 8am and then eat my next meal at 3pm, that has never happened before, I always snacked. I can control my appetite like a boss! Always had an addiction to sweets but now sometimes in the evening I say to myself ""hmm, I didnt had anything sweet today, wtf"" and Im thankful to the blends for that, and yes you need to have some willpower and not be a pu$$ to start but once you get angry with yourself and set realistic, small-to-start-with goals, you will do it with ease.

Now my girlfriend is happy that I remember small things she tells me, I feel much better overall cause I don't always digest and have unlimited energy, Im way stronger in the gym (gainz) people tell me Im on steroids which I think is a joke but I take the complement haha, my brain works at 120%, much more organised and collected, I don't get stressed that much running my business and I got time to think and do other things other than previously making myself too much food, eat it and then feel bloated and sh1t for the rest of the day.

If you‚Äôre serious about fasting and want to take your wellness journey to the next level, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is your ultimate ally. As someone who has embraced fasting as a core part of my health regimen, I can confidently say this blend has been instrumental in supporting my longest fast to date‚Äî6 full days!

What sets this blend apart is how it provides sustained energy and stamina, even during extended periods without food. Normally, by day three or four, fatigue starts to creep in, making it challenging to stay focused and energized. But with ECSTATIC, I felt a clear, steady flow of energy that kept me going, never feeling like I was about to hit a wall or collapse from exhaustion.

This blend not only fuels my body but also sharpens my mental clarity, allowing me to maintain productivity and focus throughout my fast. I found myself thinking clearer, feeling more present, and even having an enhanced sense of wellbeing, all without the usual brain fog that accompanies prolonged fasting.

For anyone looking to explore the transformative power of extended fasting while maintaining optimal energy levels and mental acuity, Interstellar Blend ECSTATIC is the key. It‚Äôs more than just a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolutionary tool for anyone looking to push their limits and achieve a new state of wellness.

I recently spent six months traveling across various countries, and one of the best decisions I made was to bring along Interstellar Blends' Gainz blend. Long-term travel can be incredibly taxing on both body and mind‚Äîirregular sleep, constant changes in time zones, and unpredictable diets can all add up to leave you feeling worn out. Luckily, Gainz came to my rescue.

Right from the start, Gainz was an absolute game-changer. I felt an impressive boost in  physical energy. I was amazed at how well I could bounce back the next day. 

The most remarkable thing about Gainz was its impact on muscle recovery and overall stamina. As someone who tries to stay fit even on the road, it‚Äôs usually tough to maintain consistency with workouts while traveling, but Gainz made it much easier. My muscle soreness was significantly reduced, and my energy levels remained steady, which kept me motivated to get those quick workouts in whenever I had the chance.

Overall, I can‚Äôt recommend Interstellar Blends and Gainz enough, especially for those on the move or looking for an edge in their physical performance and recovery.

I've been taking Interstellar Blends for several years now. My absolute must-haves are peel, spice and victorious. When I get the sniffles, half a teaspoon of victorious + 1/4 teaspoon of the others knocks it right out. I also love the beauty blend, and I notice a definite difference in my skin when I use it regularly.  But my biggest testament to Interstellar blends is for the use of hypertension.  I was diagnosed with hypertension after childbirth. I went to doctor after doctor and none could figure it out. In the years post-partum, I exercised regularly, fasted, walked miles per day and still had hypertension. ""Well, some people just have this problem and we don't know why. Take these pills"". So, I took the pills and they kept adding different pills and changing dosages and it didn't get better. I was young enough that I couldn't accept that this would be my life. So I reached out to Gavin and he recommended apigenin, aldosterone down-regulator, jing force and pulsar. I used them and reversed my hypertension in a few months.

12428,Interstellar_Blends,"Ecstatic is AMAZING!!! üòç

For the past five days, I've been taking four scoops of Trinity, two scoops of Ecstatic, and two scoops of Ascendance in a cup of black coffee. For reference, each scoop is equivalent to 1/8 of a teaspoon. 

Apart from this, I've been consuming nothing else for the rest of the day, except for a sip of water when my mouth feels dry. I wanted to see what Ecstatic can do on its own, and I added Trinity and Ascendance because I've been doing a lot of moving this week and I'm on my menstrual cycle.

The results have been significant. I now easily eat just once a day. In fact, I actually have to remind myself to eat, and I'm not really hungry. I just feel like I should eat something nutritious. This is a huge change for me because I usually want (and eat) any and everything during my menstrual cycle. 

It's a strange feeling to not be thinking about eating food all day. This is doubly significant because I'm visiting my hometown, Chicago, right now and I was worried about how I was going to manage because of all the incredible food here that's comforting to me. But I haven't even wanted anything in the four days I've been here, thanks to Ecstatic.

I almost forgot to mention that I drove from Houston to Chicago straight through. It was an 18-hour drive with no food (just the blends I mentioned earlier) and a little tiredness. The last time I did this trip, I had to stop overnight and sleep. Not this time.

What‚Äôs up, everybody! I just had to share my immense gratitude and the life-changing experience I‚Äôve had with Gavin‚Äôs creation Interstellar Blends.

My name is Francis, I‚Äôm 28, and I‚Äôm from Quebec, Canada. To give you some context, I‚Äôm workin four jobs, 3 are extremely physical, and the 4th is trading which demand alot of mental power and focus. In the summer, I work 16 to 18 hours a day, sometimes even more. It‚Äôs absolutely draining.

By the end of 2023, my body and mind hit a breaking point. The nonstop grind caught up.. I hit a wall make of fuc‚Ä¶. titanium‚Ä¶ My whole system was shutdown, It got me crazy health issues.. I was dealing out of nowhere with fungal infections, constant headaches, autoimmune flare-ups, MCAS, and a completely wrecked nervous system. My nervous system was so shut, I was shaking when standing up, my whole mind was in the dark,, depressive spiral, and I started having thoughts I‚Äôd never wish on anyone, it was HELL‚Ä¶.

That‚Äôs when, by the grace of God, Gavin announced a challenge to win a 25 Blend Mega Combo and guess what? My friend and I WON! This was a blessing because I had no idea how to recover from this hole I was in..

When the package arrived, it was game on! I immediately started fasting with the blends and water for six days to start my recovery ASAP. Normally fasting for me is kinda Hard and by day 2 Im half dead in my bed wondering why the F I started a fast LOL , I‚Äôd be drained, barely functioning. but with the blends is another dimension literally..! It didnt felt like a was fasting AT ALL.

By the 2rd day, I was sleeping like a Rock which I wasnt able to do for at least 1y, and waking up feeling like a whole new person. I couldn‚Äôt believe how effortless fasting felt. For anyone who struggles with fasting, seriously, reach out to Gavin. Just follow the steps Gavin gives you, and you‚Äôll be golden Fast!

After the 6 day fast, I broke the fast with some worries because I have bad experience of refeeding in the past. Ive put the worries aside and broke the fast the best I could, and‚Ä¶. Not a SINGLE issues! No histamine flares up, no pain, nothing!. This blew my mind because I‚Äôve had severe digestive problems since I was 5yo, like MCAS, SIBO, SIFO, and mold toxicity. In the past, fasting always came with nasty, crazy symptoms, especially during refeeding. But with the blends, I bounced back like I never though possible. TONS of energy, laser focus for trading and vitality was through the roof.

I‚Äôve done ALOT lab testing the past 5years to track pathogens, deficiencies, and other health issues. After just one month on the blends, I did the same lab test and 80% of the issues, pathogen and defiencies were completely rGONE . In one freaking month.. It still doesnt make sense to me LOLL Good luck finding a doctor that will do that for you‚Ä¶

On top of that, my hair is growing back after starting to bald at 23! Super Tonic Hair for the win! Talking about Wins.. LOL If you ever had ED type of issues‚Ä¶. Thunder is quite insane and effective‚Ä¶ I will no into details but It was life changing for multiple person AHAH

If you have digestive issues you HAVE to take the Stomach Reset Combo. The first 3 day with the Purge can be a mess, It was for me. But after the big clean up, it feels like you are flying, heaviness is lifted from your soul!

I cant thank Gavin enough for this incredible opportunity. The timing was divine and it saved my life. I wasnt sure how I‚Äôd pull myself out of this mess I was in , but with God‚Äôs grace, I took the chance and it was worth it 10000%

Now, still thriving! I gave some of the blends to close familly member espacially Victorious when they got Cov. Victo with Peels and Spice Got Cov down in 2 days ! This is revolutionary lol.

12431,Interstellar_Blends,"Top review for Spice and Peel Herbs 

Having relocated to Texas over a decade ago, I found myself facing the harsh realities of seasonal allergies, particularly due to the high levels of cedar pollen. Initially, my experience was frustrating and debilitating, as I frequently battled upper respiratory infections and bronchitis, often accompanied by a relentless cough. While my doctor prescribed Claritin D and regular Claritin, I quickly became dependent on these medications just to feel somewhat functional. 

After several years of this struggle, I began to notice some unwanted side effects from daily use, particularly persistent constipation. Despite trying teas and other remedies, nothing seemed to provide the relief I desperately needed‚Äîuntil about a year ago, when a friend introduced me to the Purge herb from Interstellar Herbs. This particular herb worked wonders for me, sparking my curiosity to explore their other offerings. I decided to try the Spice and Peel herbs for my allergies. I will admit, there was some hesitation on my part; I had grown so reliant on Claritin D that I was apprehensive about going a day without it. I even contemplated my doctor‚Äôs advice to undergo testing, but it required me to be off the medication for at least a week.

When I finally mustered the courage to take the leap, I was astonished. That very first night, I was free of congestion, and the next morning, I could finally breathe through both nostrils‚Äîsomething that had become a rarity for me. It was a moment of realization; I had become addicted to pseudoephedrine, a substance commonly used in the creation of meth. My last order (#67603) in June 2024 included these two amazing herbs, and I can't express how grateful I am that they worked. These herbs are truly life-changing for me, and I wholeheartedly recommend Interstellar Herbs to everyone struggling with similar issues. If you're searching for natural, effective relief from allergies, look no further than Interstellar Herbs!

From the moment I jumped on Interstellar Blends website, I was impressed by Gavin‚Äôs deep knowledge of health and longevity. His passion for helping others is evident, and he truly goes above and beyond. What sets him apart is not just his expertise, but also his genuine commitment to his customers. Gavin always does what he says he will do, and you can trust that he has your best interests at heart.

I have personally experienced a remarkable improvement in my health, energy levels, sleep, digestion, hormone regulation, brain function and muscle growth since incorporating his blends into my routine. Each product is thoughtfully crafted, and I appreciate the transparency regarding the ingredients and their benefits. It's clear that Gavin invests time and effort into ensuring his blends are not just effective but also safe and bioavailable.

One of the most impactful experiences has been the guidance Gavin provided to my dad after his recent heart attack. Understanding the critical importance of diet in recovery, LDL vs HDL, Gavin spent hours discussing tailored dietary changes and specific products that would support my dad's healing process. He not only recommended specific blends and amounts, but he recommended products such as a specific olive oil from another company. His recommendations have made a significant difference, providing my father with the tools he needs to reclaim his health, vitality and stay off dangerous drugs such as Statins.

If you're seeking exceptional health, expert advice and high-quality products that genuinely deliver results, I wholeheartedly recommend Interstellar Blends. Gavin's dedication to health and wellness, coupled with his personalized approach, makes Interstellar Blends not only important, but, for me, something my body obviously needed and I will be happy to be with them for the rest of my life.

Three Months In ‚Äì Real Results, No BS

I‚Äôve been using Interstellar Blends for three months, and the results are legit.

Started with Rewire and immediately felt the brain kick. After I gave Gavin a full breakdown of what I was dealing with, he put together a personalized stack. I ended up going with the $777 package, which came with 18 blends total. He even threw in a couple extras. Texting with him is quick and direct‚Äîsuper helpful.

Favorites so far:
	‚Ä¢	Thunder ‚Äì hits even at half dose
	‚Ä¢	Nebula ‚Äì clean, sustained energy
	‚Ä¢	Ascendance ‚Äì crushing 20 years of chronic pain
	‚Ä¢	HELICOBACTER ‚Äì completely ended my nightly heartburn, got me back to mouth taping after 3 months off
	‚Ä¢	Purge ‚Äì steady, no-pressure weight loss over the last few months

His pine pollen is top-tier. I tried a replacement off Amazon‚Äîtasted like cardboard. Got a refund and went back to the real deal.

Biggest shift: I‚Äôve decided to come off TRT after a year. These blends gave me the confidence and physical support to make that call.

I recently experienced an incredible journey with Autonomous Rewire and Trinity, paired with deep meditation. I believe I reached the ultimate state of zen. During this process, I felt as though I was in a deep sleep and even achieved astral projection. I vividly saw myself sleeping, with my hands glowing in vibrant, multicolored transparency. I floated around my house and even observed my dad sleeping. It was an awesome experience‚Äîuntil I encountered some things I wasn't quite prepared for during my second attempt.

  


In previous discussions with my group, we explored these topics extensively, and I want to emphasize the importance of being spiritually ready for such experiences. I am truly grateful for Gavin's work; he is incredibly dedicated and outworks everyone out there. After just two days of using Autonomous, I feel like I've returned to 100% hustle‚Äîmy focus and motivation are at an all-time high.

  


Autonomous has been a game-changer for managing my ADHD; nothing else has worked as effectively for me. However, I urge everyone to know their limits when it comes to practices like astral projection and lucid dreaming.¬†

12446,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts about the game

Game has potential.  I really enjoyed playing it.  A few of my thoughts that might make the game more enjoyable for others.

 The ai's still need tweaking I feel like.  I see them flying a lot of empty legs both to and from different planet's.  I look at the income chart for all the companies and I noticed that all the ai's at some point will make this same crash and burn.  They'll do nothing for longest while, then buy 20 ships, fly them empty and then go away for awhile.

The thing that bothered me the most was the reputation system.  I like the idea of it but in practice it seems like more of a headache.  I think it may need some tweaking so that it is less senstive to changes.  I feel like I gear up to start serving a planet and by the time I have the resources to actually make a difference, my reputation is almost zero and I can't  develope the planet at all.  This was a huge headache in my first real play through as my ability to leave the starting system was completely halted becuase my reputaion with the only plane that could get me out of system was zero.  Now I realize that's mostly my fault, but once it reached zero, I could not raise and keep it high enough to really do anything with the planet.  This basically limited me to the starting system.

Some things that came to my mind as I was playing that might make things more interesting:
-Get politics invovled (airlines get very political when it comes to slot space at airports, maybe not every planet can sustain a massive space port?)
-Board room disputes would be a cool and different way to go, this can also lead into mergers, acquisitions and hostile takeovers.
-Maybe try to add a terrain like feature?  Maybe strange anomolies that aren't understood block certain routes in space, maybe even a black hole that you have to navigate around.
-A rocket capable of interstellar travel would be pretty handy, don't know if I never made it that far in the game, but there were moments that would have been nice to have.
-If you sell a ship don't just delete the cargo but have it off loaded on the planet it is at
-Just like how you can schedule a ship to be sold, do the same with the change chargo loadout function

12450,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts on the game

Hi there,  certainly enjoy the game.  Both the concept and design are fun for me.

With that being said, there are some things I'm wondering about, some quality of life improvements I'd love to see. I know the dev team are working hard, and just wanted to say thanks and give a few ideas at this stage of development.

1. Planet list needed - It gets frustrating having to go to each and every colony to check on how they are doing and what they need or are full up on.  Having a list that can be sorted by things such as system, demand, extra, and so on would be quite helpful.

2. Traveler queue - The traveler queue, while a neat idea to have in its current form, it ends up being hard to figure out how many folks are waiting to go places sometimes.  Not to mention that if there's a huge queue, as Earth often gets when there's lots of new colonies, I literally can't even see how many folks are waiting if they are too far back in the queue.  I think having a list here, and maybe with certain details such as an average wait time per colonist (I know colonist wait time affects planetary reputation), # of colonists/business/tourist travelers, and then demand for seat type on the ships would be nice.

3. Waiting for dilithium fuel - I've had a problem with this where I have a fair number of colonies developing in a new system.  What I've found is that if I start producing fuel in that system, then even though ships had been going to and from the other planets just fine before, they now just sit there waiting for fuel until I send it from the one fuel producing planet.  If the ship is on a planet without fuel, and it has enough to make it back to its destination, can it just go there perhaps?

4. Waiting for full load after changing ship's route - Similar to #3, I've found that after changing a ship to a new route, if it's shipping water for instance, and it's supposed to have a full load from one planet and then take it to another planet, if the next planet it lands on won't let it fill up then it just sits there forever until I notice and manually tell it to stop and then start again.  It usually flies after that happens.  (example: Ship 1 is going from planet A to planet B shipping water from A to B.  While en route to planet B I decide it needs to change routes so that it‚Äôs shipping water from planet A to planet C.  It then lands on planet B, unloads its water, and won‚Äôt fly again because it can‚Äôt fill up with water on planet B.)

5. Earth founds new colonies way too fast sometimes - I've found that Earth founds tons of new colonies and there's no way for me to keep up and manage getting them all up and running.  The pace before interstellar travel opens up is fast, but I was able to manage pretty well and kept shortages to a minimum. However, Earth then started founding new colonies before I even had access to interstellar ships in the first place.  They would then found new colonies on the regular and not seem to care that I couldn't support them.  The other 2 companies in my game weren't doing that great.  One was liquidated and the other has yet to get interstellar ships after nearly 100 years of gameplay.  As the only company trying to support colonization, I just had to let a bunch of colonies die.  Trying to support them ended up costing me money on a colony that died off anyway.

6. I think it's unfortunate that upgrading planets is almost entirely punitive unless it's the spaceport - Every planetary upgrade costs a bunch of money and also hurts your reputation with that planet.  Further, many of the upgrades can help your competitors a bunch as well.  As my one game that I've played for quite some time didn't really have any competition and is largely a sandbox now, I don't know how it plays out long-term with competition in the mix.  But at this point I would expect that if I'm spending tons of money to improve the industry on a planet that I'd get some amount of bonus for that.  Like having the option to get a certain share of the new goods put into my own hangar perhaps?  Not harming reputation for all improvements?  I don't know the right answer here, but it just feels strange that investing in a planet would hurt so much.

Again, just some of my thoughts on the game.  I‚Äôm enjoying the game and think it has a lot of potential.  Thanks for all the hard work!

If anyone wants to discuss, I‚Äôll try checking this thread again soon.

12453,InterstellarTransport,"36 hours in - suggestions and bugs I came across

First of all I want to say that I really enjoy this game so far.

So in one game earth settled a planet in another (far away) star system. I couldnt reach it with any of the ships available. Year 2066 - Doeing49, Gorman Starchaser and Spacebus D530 can't reach it. So how got it settled in the first place? ;) Am I supposed to subsidize a colony in between? That doesn't feel right. Later that game the KHI Byeolwamul also wasn't able to reach it.
I had another bug where I could order a interstellar starship (KHI) but it kept saying ""waiting for dilithium fuel"" although I had 1k+ on the same planet.

I think it's known that the order ship button bugs out quite often. It seems that sometimes when you try to order a ship and the massage ""spaceport to small"" pops up and you keep the window for purchasing ships open - while upgrading the spaceport (or messing with the un/loading options of a route) it CAN bug out. Although I just tried to reproduce this bug and it worked just fine so idk. 

When you have the small window of a ship open - and it arrives at a spacepot the display shows -0,00$ profit.

Suggestions:
Tooltips when you hover over the small buttons of the small window when you have a ship selected (I wanted to suggest that you add a ""clone ship"" button to that window only to find out it already exists XD
Arrow keys for switching through colonized planets.
Don't allow settlements in other star systems before any dilithium fuel is produced.
Add the option to silence ""pling"" of an arriving ship. (I want to hear the sound of a femine / new colony / new ship ect.) 

Edit:
Some questions: What does the ""player difficulty"" setting change?
What seating do colonist prefer? Seems like they fly first class in the begining of the game but later they want to fly coach class?

12454,InterstellarTransport,"Reputation glitch?

Loving this game so far after about 10 hours of gameplay, but I have some qualms about reputation.
When building an office, upgrading one, or even demolishing one, my reputation on that planet takes a 3-7% dip.  Is this intended?  Shouldn't building or upgrading an office boost your reputation?
In my last game I erroneously thought that offices would stack (tool tip clearly states they don't :/ ).  So I demolished the second small office on earth leaving the original large office, but those two 'office transactions' made my reputation dive almost 10% on earth, leaving my transports waiting forever to load up machinery.  It was almost game breaking, but I eventually recovered by focusing on clearing my passenger queue on earth.

12455,InterstellarTransport,"Ship upgrade idea

Hi guys,

Was wondering if there was any plans to implement customization for the ships? I know you can upgrade to a different ship, but I was thinking more along the lines of keeping the same ships, and adding ""modules"" or something to improve it's stats, e.g. adding a better Engine or Thrusters to increase speed, more efficient Fuel converters so that it costs less fuel per run, increased cargo capacity, add a Warp drive, etc. 

Obviously there would still need to be limits to ships, like the 1st generation of ships can only be upgraded so much, like they can only have up to Rank 2 modules... This would also open up things like requiring machinery on planets that are fully upgraded if they have a specific building on the planet, which would be required to perform such upgrades.

Just some food for thought :)

12456,InterstellarTransport,"Bug Report - Khi Keun with 147 cargo slots!

Hi guys,

Just been going through my old ships and upgrading them, wasn't quite expecting to be able to do so this much... 

[imgur](https://imgur.com/a/jLTrk)

Initial ship was a Spacebus D520, clicked on ""Upgrade Ship"" and then changed some of the cargo slot items, whilst at the same time clicking between planets to determine the best supply/demand for each resource. When I was reducing the water slots, I noticed that as I removed points it wasn't updating the visual underneath, but the number at the side was in fact changing. I tried adding Water and it let me do so, and with Machinery, up until the value stopped increasing, and the image above is what I ended up with. 

I tried this again on another Spacebus but wasn't able to replicate it, but I'll do some more testing when I get home from work - I'll let you know if I figure out how I managed it, haha.

12457,InterstellarTransport,"Struggling to find Saved Games, and issue buying certain ships

Hi guys, just struggling with a few bits here - though it's probably me being thick!

Trying to find a save in the list is difficult, plus it doesn't seem to show all of my saves. The auto-save feature seems to create a new file for each save, as I have about 70+ in the list and I'm only on my 3rd attempt not to go bankrupt, haha. In any case, my latest save I did manually before going offline for a moment, and now it doesn't seem to be in the list. Where do these files save on my machine, and would it do any harm if I deleted the ones that I don't need?

Secondly, in my most recent playthrough I was at a point where I could buy the Khi Geodaehan ship, and had enough cash to do so! I had upgraded the Spaceport on Earth to 11, Luna was at 8, and Titan was at 8. I determined it's cargo hold, and selected ""Launch Immediately"", ""Luna Titan Direct"" as the route, and ""Earth"" as the delivery location. Normally I don't have any issues with buying ships like this, but no matter how many times I choose ""Order Ship"", it doesn't go through. Any pointers as to what I'm doing wrong?

Aside from those quirks, loving the game so far. Bought it on Thursday and haven't been able to put it down! Great work guys, keep it up!

1. a search feature. (if there is one already, i haven't found it) i have several events for Pleione 3 in my event log and i still have no damn clue where that even is.

2.  the thing that the goods type filter view (controls on the bottom right) does, but organized in a spreadsheet table.

this window should show all planets (one planet for each row). then we would able to filter for a cargo type. 

the columns would then show for each planet row:

- amount of the cargo type available

- amount of the cargo type produced/consumed weekly

- amount of the cargo type  delivered/picked up weekly (average over a selectable time frame)

- amount of the cargo type  combined produced/consumed and delivered/picked up. if the planet produced 10 excess cargo type and we trade 15 away, this column would read `-5`

 this is the column where we decide which ships to send to a different route.

 if this number is very negative, we know we need to haul more of the selected cargo type to the planetoid on this row.

 if this number is very positive, we can look in the third column if we are delivering cargo unnecessarily, or use this planet as a source for the selected cargo type.

while very spreadhsheety, this view would be much better than having to go to each of the green planets  to determine which one needs water the most urgently.

a luxury bonus would be an additional column where the time until the amount available on the planetoid reaches 0 is predicted.",2017-10-17 19:33:39,3,0,0.9388,1,1,1.0

12461,InterstellarTransport,"Some Quality of Life Suggestions for Organization

I've only had time to play for a couple hours so far and it's a great game, but I have a couple quick quality of life suggestions to make organization easier. (And if some of this is implemented already then please let me know how!)

1. Adding a few filters to the ships screen would be ideal, so you could sort by cargo type, ship size, name, trade route, etc. I think particularly useful would be having the screen start with your routes and you can expand them to show all the ships working on that route. It would help when you have dozens and dozens of ships later on.

2. Have the option to modify cargo loading/unloading rules for all the resources at once. It's tedious if I want to just have a route purely for food and have to click through every single one to disable the loading and unloading. I know you can control some of this by ship design but it would still be a nice option.

3. I think I've seen this suggested, but adding a list of the buildings on planet would be easier to navigate than spinning around trying to find your buildings.

Again, forgive me if these are implemented already, and please let me know where to find them.

12462,InterstellarTransport,"Great Game! A Couple Questions...

First I just want to say I really like this game, it's a lot of fun and I'm very excited for the multiplayer. Until then I'm trying my best to understand the game. A few questions:

1) I've seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets. My boxes are gray and I can't change them, is this a new update?

2) It's hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport food/consumer goods/rare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage. Sometimes it transports food and I make $0 on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet i'm transporting to. I know I can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless I say otherwise.

3) I'm having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet. For example if machines are at +4 units/unit time (week?) and my ship holds 25 units, I want to wait for a full load. I set this in the criteria and I see whenever the planet produces some, it goes to 0. I assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but I then saw another company ship export 25/25 and my ship still showed 0/25. This was very frustrating. Do we not split the produced resources, or is it a FIFO setting for ships set with full load setting?

4) The supply/demand charts don't explain to me how much $$ I will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless i'm missing something. Wish this was more clear

5) It would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship. Overall profit is nice but I'd like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall.

Picked it up today and started playing a bit. It's pretty fun, though I have a little bit of feedback. It looks like the AI in my game bankrupt themselves by buying up 5+ pads at each planet and trying to colonize other planets too aggressively. 

Edit: As a follow-up, I think it might be worth tweaking the pricing for larger ships. Smaller ships are better for volume/$. I'm fine with the idea, but late game the performance doesn't scale as well. As a small nod towards late game performance I think a small price decrease would be worth it.

I enjoyed the challenge of the first playthrough, and discovering all of the hidden traps that can kill you.  

Then I enjoyed solely responsible, calculating the appropriate ratios over time necessary to get all of the home planets to 100 development 

Then I enjoyed the high score system, re-playing the first year over and over to get the highest fares - fuel i could, then repeating that strategy for 10 yrs to get high scores.  

The challenge of getting a 100 development planet in another star system was fun... you really have to pump out boat loads of dilithium, and then put 2 refineries on every home planet, just to get enough fuel to sustain your home away from home... it really gives you the insentive to grow your home world beyond just 'profitable'...

12482,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts about the game

Game has potential.  I really enjoyed playing it.  A few of my thoughts that might make the game more enjoyable for others.

 The ai's still need tweaking I feel like.  I see them flying a lot of empty legs both to and from different planet's.  I look at the income chart for all the companies and I noticed that all the ai's at some point will make this same crash and burn.  They'll do nothing for longest while, then buy 20 ships, fly them empty and then go away for awhile.

The thing that bothered me the most was the reputation system.  I like the idea of it but in practice it seems like more of a headache.  I think it may need some tweaking so that it is less senstive to changes.  I feel like I gear up to start serving a planet and by the time I have the resources to actually make a difference, my reputation is almost zero and I can't  develope the planet at all.  This was a huge headache in my first real play through as my ability to leave the starting system was completely halted becuase my reputaion with the only plane that could get me out of system was zero.  Now I realize that's mostly my fault, but once it reached zero, I could not raise and keep it high enough to really do anything with the planet.  This basically limited me to the starting system.

Some things that came to my mind as I was playing that might make things more interesting:
-Get politics invovled (airlines get very political when it comes to slot space at airports, maybe not every planet can sustain a massive space port?)
-Board room disputes would be a cool and different way to go, this can also lead into mergers, acquisitions and hostile takeovers.
-Maybe try to add a terrain like feature?  Maybe strange anomolies that aren't understood block certain routes in space, maybe even a black hole that you have to navigate around.
-A rocket capable of interstellar travel would be pretty handy, don't know if I never made it that far in the game, but there were moments that would have been nice to have.
-If you sell a ship don't just delete the cargo but have it off loaded on the planet it is at
-Just like how you can schedule a ship to be sold, do the same with the change chargo loadout function

12486,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts on the game

Hi there,  certainly enjoy the game.  Both the concept and design are fun for me.

With that being said, there are some things I'm wondering about, some quality of life improvements I'd love to see. I know the dev team are working hard, and just wanted to say thanks and give a few ideas at this stage of development.

1. Planet list needed - It gets frustrating having to go to each and every colony to check on how they are doing and what they need or are full up on.  Having a list that can be sorted by things such as system, demand, extra, and so on would be quite helpful.

2. Traveler queue - The traveler queue, while a neat idea to have in its current form, it ends up being hard to figure out how many folks are waiting to go places sometimes.  Not to mention that if there's a huge queue, as Earth often gets when there's lots of new colonies, I literally can't even see how many folks are waiting if they are too far back in the queue.  I think having a list here, and maybe with certain details such as an average wait time per colonist (I know colonist wait time affects planetary reputation), # of colonists/business/tourist travelers, and then demand for seat type on the ships would be nice.

3. Waiting for dilithium fuel - I've had a problem with this where I have a fair number of colonies developing in a new system.  What I've found is that if I start producing fuel in that system, then even though ships had been going to and from the other planets just fine before, they now just sit there waiting for fuel until I send it from the one fuel producing planet.  If the ship is on a planet without fuel, and it has enough to make it back to its destination, can it just go there perhaps?

4. Waiting for full load after changing ship's route - Similar to #3, I've found that after changing a ship to a new route, if it's shipping water for instance, and it's supposed to have a full load from one planet and then take it to another planet, if the next planet it lands on won't let it fill up then it just sits there forever until I notice and manually tell it to stop and then start again.  It usually flies after that happens.  (example: Ship 1 is going from planet A to planet B shipping water from A to B.  While en route to planet B I decide it needs to change routes so that it‚Äôs shipping water from planet A to planet C.  It then lands on planet B, unloads its water, and won‚Äôt fly again because it can‚Äôt fill up with water on planet B.)

5. Earth founds new colonies way too fast sometimes - I've found that Earth founds tons of new colonies and there's no way for me to keep up and manage getting them all up and running.  The pace before interstellar travel opens up is fast, but I was able to manage pretty well and kept shortages to a minimum. However, Earth then started founding new colonies before I even had access to interstellar ships in the first place.  They would then found new colonies on the regular and not seem to care that I couldn't support them.  The other 2 companies in my game weren't doing that great.  One was liquidated and the other has yet to get interstellar ships after nearly 100 years of gameplay.  As the only company trying to support colonization, I just had to let a bunch of colonies die.  Trying to support them ended up costing me money on a colony that died off anyway.

6. I think it's unfortunate that upgrading planets is almost entirely punitive unless it's the spaceport - Every planetary upgrade costs a bunch of money and also hurts your reputation with that planet.  Further, many of the upgrades can help your competitors a bunch as well.  As my one game that I've played for quite some time didn't really have any competition and is largely a sandbox now, I don't know how it plays out long-term with competition in the mix.  But at this point I would expect that if I'm spending tons of money to improve the industry on a planet that I'd get some amount of bonus for that.  Like having the option to get a certain share of the new goods put into my own hangar perhaps?  Not harming reputation for all improvements?  I don't know the right answer here, but it just feels strange that investing in a planet would hurt so much.

Again, just some of my thoughts on the game.  I‚Äôm enjoying the game and think it has a lot of potential.  Thanks for all the hard work!

If anyone wants to discuss, I‚Äôll try checking this thread again soon.

12489,InterstellarTransport,"36 hours in - suggestions and bugs I came across

First of all I want to say that I really enjoy this game so far.

So in one game earth settled a planet in another (far away) star system. I couldnt reach it with any of the ships available. Year 2066 - Doeing49, Gorman Starchaser and Spacebus D530 can't reach it. So how got it settled in the first place? ;) Am I supposed to subsidize a colony in between? That doesn't feel right. Later that game the KHI Byeolwamul also wasn't able to reach it.
I had another bug where I could order a interstellar starship (KHI) but it kept saying ""waiting for dilithium fuel"" although I had 1k+ on the same planet.

I think it's known that the order ship button bugs out quite often. It seems that sometimes when you try to order a ship and the massage ""spaceport to small"" pops up and you keep the window for purchasing ships open - while upgrading the spaceport (or messing with the un/loading options of a route) it CAN bug out. Although I just tried to reproduce this bug and it worked just fine so idk. 

When you have the small window of a ship open - and it arrives at a spacepot the display shows -0,00$ profit.

Suggestions:
Tooltips when you hover over the small buttons of the small window when you have a ship selected (I wanted to suggest that you add a ""clone ship"" button to that window only to find out it already exists XD
Arrow keys for switching through colonized planets.
Don't allow settlements in other star systems before any dilithium fuel is produced.
Add the option to silence ""pling"" of an arriving ship. (I want to hear the sound of a femine / new colony / new ship ect.) 

Edit:
Some questions: What does the ""player difficulty"" setting change?
What seating do colonist prefer? Seems like they fly first class in the begining of the game but later they want to fly coach class?

12490,InterstellarTransport,"Reputation glitch?

Loving this game so far after about 10 hours of gameplay, but I have some qualms about reputation.
When building an office, upgrading one, or even demolishing one, my reputation on that planet takes a 3-7% dip.  Is this intended?  Shouldn't building or upgrading an office boost your reputation?
In my last game I erroneously thought that offices would stack (tool tip clearly states they don't :/ ).  So I demolished the second small office on earth leaving the original large office, but those two 'office transactions' made my reputation dive almost 10% on earth, leaving my transports waiting forever to load up machinery.  It was almost game breaking, but I eventually recovered by focusing on clearing my passenger queue on earth.

Overall the reputation system seems a bit wonky and harsh...  anyone have any insight into this?",2017-12-07 14:59:37,2,0,0.9035,1,1,1.0
12491,InterstellarTransport,"Ship upgrade idea

Hi guys,

Was wondering if there was any plans to implement customization for the ships? I know you can upgrade to a different ship, but I was thinking more along the lines of keeping the same ships, and adding ""modules"" or something to improve it's stats, e.g. adding a better Engine or Thrusters to increase speed, more efficient Fuel converters so that it costs less fuel per run, increased cargo capacity, add a Warp drive, etc. 

Obviously there would still need to be limits to ships, like the 1st generation of ships can only be upgraded so much, like they can only have up to Rank 2 modules... This would also open up things like requiring machinery on planets that are fully upgraded if they have a specific building on the planet, which would be required to perform such upgrades.

Just some food for thought :)

12492,InterstellarTransport,"Bug Report - Khi Keun with 147 cargo slots!

Hi guys,

Just been going through my old ships and upgrading them, wasn't quite expecting to be able to do so this much... 

[imgur](https://imgur.com/a/jLTrk)

Initial ship was a Spacebus D520, clicked on ""Upgrade Ship"" and then changed some of the cargo slot items, whilst at the same time clicking between planets to determine the best supply/demand for each resource. When I was reducing the water slots, I noticed that as I removed points it wasn't updating the visual underneath, but the number at the side was in fact changing. I tried adding Water and it let me do so, and with Machinery, up until the value stopped increasing, and the image above is what I ended up with. 

I tried this again on another Spacebus but wasn't able to replicate it, but I'll do some more testing when I get home from work - I'll let you know if I figure out how I managed it, haha.

12493,InterstellarTransport,"Struggling to find Saved Games, and issue buying certain ships

Hi guys, just struggling with a few bits here - though it's probably me being thick!

Trying to find a save in the list is difficult, plus it doesn't seem to show all of my saves. The auto-save feature seems to create a new file for each save, as I have about 70+ in the list and I'm only on my 3rd attempt not to go bankrupt, haha. In any case, my latest save I did manually before going offline for a moment, and now it doesn't seem to be in the list. Where do these files save on my machine, and would it do any harm if I deleted the ones that I don't need?

Secondly, in my most recent playthrough I was at a point where I could buy the Khi Geodaehan ship, and had enough cash to do so! I had upgraded the Spaceport on Earth to 11, Luna was at 8, and Titan was at 8. I determined it's cargo hold, and selected ""Launch Immediately"", ""Luna Titan Direct"" as the route, and ""Earth"" as the delivery location. Normally I don't have any issues with buying ships like this, but no matter how many times I choose ""Order Ship"", it doesn't go through. Any pointers as to what I'm doing wrong?

Aside from those quirks, loving the game so far. Bought it on Thursday and haven't been able to put it down! Great work guys, keep it up!

1. a search feature. (if there is one already, i haven't found it) i have several events for Pleione 3 in my event log and i still have no damn clue where that even is.

2.  the thing that the goods type filter view (controls on the bottom right) does, but organized in a spreadsheet table.

this window should show all planets (one planet for each row). then we would able to filter for a cargo type. 

the columns would then show for each planet row:

- amount of the cargo type available

- amount of the cargo type produced/consumed weekly

- amount of the cargo type  delivered/picked up weekly (average over a selectable time frame)

- amount of the cargo type  combined produced/consumed and delivered/picked up. if the planet produced 10 excess cargo type and we trade 15 away, this column would read `-5`

 this is the column where we decide which ships to send to a different route.

 if this number is very negative, we know we need to haul more of the selected cargo type to the planetoid on this row.

 if this number is very positive, we can look in the third column if we are delivering cargo unnecessarily, or use this planet as a source for the selected cargo type.

while very spreadhsheety, this view would be much better than having to go to each of the green planets  to determine which one needs water the most urgently.

a luxury bonus would be an additional column where the time until the amount available on the planetoid reaches 0 is predicted.",2017-10-17 19:33:39,3,0,0.9388,1,1,1.0

12497,InterstellarTransport,"Some Quality of Life Suggestions for Organization

I've only had time to play for a couple hours so far and it's a great game, but I have a couple quick quality of life suggestions to make organization easier. (And if some of this is implemented already then please let me know how!)

1. Adding a few filters to the ships screen would be ideal, so you could sort by cargo type, ship size, name, trade route, etc. I think particularly useful would be having the screen start with your routes and you can expand them to show all the ships working on that route. It would help when you have dozens and dozens of ships later on.

2. Have the option to modify cargo loading/unloading rules for all the resources at once. It's tedious if I want to just have a route purely for food and have to click through every single one to disable the loading and unloading. I know you can control some of this by ship design but it would still be a nice option.

3. I think I've seen this suggested, but adding a list of the buildings on planet would be easier to navigate than spinning around trying to find your buildings.

Again, forgive me if these are implemented already, and please let me know where to find them.

12498,InterstellarTransport,"Great Game! A Couple Questions...

First I just want to say I really like this game, it's a lot of fun and I'm very excited for the multiplayer. Until then I'm trying my best to understand the game. A few questions:

1) I've seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets. My boxes are gray and I can't change them, is this a new update?

2) It's hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport food/consumer goods/rare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage. Sometimes it transports food and I make $0 on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet i'm transporting to. I know I can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless I say otherwise.

3) I'm having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet. For example if machines are at +4 units/unit time (week?) and my ship holds 25 units, I want to wait for a full load. I set this in the criteria and I see whenever the planet produces some, it goes to 0. I assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but I then saw another company ship export 25/25 and my ship still showed 0/25. This was very frustrating. Do we not split the produced resources, or is it a FIFO setting for ships set with full load setting?

4) The supply/demand charts don't explain to me how much $$ I will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless i'm missing something. Wish this was more clear

5) It would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship. Overall profit is nice but I'd like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall.

Edit: As a follow-up, I think it might be worth tweaking the pricing for larger ships. Smaller ships are better for volume/$. I'm fine with the idea, but late game the performance doesn't scale as well. As a small nod towards late game performance I think a small price decrease would be worth it.

I was watching a let's play earlier and the guy was up to his 400th ship or some large number. It seems like the ship naming system could use some work. Are there plans to fix this in the near future? It would be a huge QOL improvement if the ships could be assigned to a trade route and then spawn new numbers like that. I wish I could iterate this better but I would be lying if I claimed I were intimately familiar with the mechanics, I will likely give more coherent answers in the future

The challenge of getting a 100 development planet in another star system was fun... you really have to pump out boat loads of dilithium, and then put 2 refineries on every home planet, just to get enough fuel to sustain your home away from home... it really gives you the insentive to grow your home world beyond just 'profitable'...  
I enjoyed playing thru each of the other game types for 10 years just to set high scores and get a feel for how the modes work.

60 hours of fun is plenty for the price point, and I consider this game well worth the money and worth recommending :)   cya.",2019-07-17 11:24:06,12,0,0.9847,1,1,1.0

12524,InterstellarTransport,"Some Quality of Life Suggestions for Organization

I've only had time to play for a couple hours so far and it's a great game, but I have a couple quick quality of life suggestions to make organization easier. (And if some of this is implemented already then please let me know how!)

1. Adding a few filters to the ships screen would be ideal, so you could sort by cargo type, ship size, name, trade route, etc. I think particularly useful would be having the screen start with your routes and you can expand them to show all the ships working on that route. It would help when you have dozens and dozens of ships later on.

2. Have the option to modify cargo loading/unloading rules for all the resources at once. It's tedious if I want to just have a route purely for food and have to click through every single one to disable the loading and unloading. I know you can control some of this by ship design but it would still be a nice option.

3. I think I've seen this suggested, but adding a list of the buildings on planet would be easier to navigate than spinning around trying to find your buildings.

Again, forgive me if these are implemented already, and please let me know where to find them.

Great game so far and I look forward to its continued development!",2017-08-22 13:28:08,6,0,0.9932,1,1,1.0
12525,InterstellarTransport,"Great Game! A Couple Questions...

First I just want to say I really like this game, it's a lot of fun and I'm very excited for the multiplayer. Until then I'm trying my best to understand the game. A few questions:

1) I've seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets. My boxes are gray and I can't change them, is this a new update?

2) It's hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport food/consumer goods/rare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage. Sometimes it transports food and I make $0 on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet i'm transporting to. I know I can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless I say otherwise.

3) I'm having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet. For example if machines are at +4 units/unit time (week?) and my ship holds 25 units, I want to wait for a full load. I set this in the criteria and I see whenever the planet produces some, it goes to 0. I assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but I then saw another company ship export 25/25 and my ship still showed 0/25. This was very frustrating. Do we not split the produced resources, or is it a FIFO setting for ships set with full load setting?

4) The supply/demand charts don't explain to me how much $$ I will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless i'm missing something. Wish this was more clear

5) It would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship. Overall profit is nice but I'd like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall.

Thanks for making a great game! Looking forward to updates!",2017-08-21 17:31:46,5,0,0.991,1,1,1.0
12526,InterstellarTransport,"Very fun game. Glad to see it on early access

Picked it up today and started playing a bit. It's pretty fun, though I have a little bit of feedback. It looks like the AI in my game bankrupt themselves by buying up 5+ pads at each planet and trying to colonize other planets too aggressively. 

Edit: As a follow-up, I think it might be worth tweaking the pricing for larger ships. Smaller ships are better for volume/$. I'm fine with the idea, but late game the performance doesn't scale as well. As a small nod towards late game performance I think a small price decrease would be worth it.

Starting tips: I usually use 10:10:5 Food:Water:First Class, for the D500's and I spam the hell out of them. The key thing to do is crank up ticket price to ~1k in the route menu. Once you have those raking in money you can go nuts.",2017-08-16 19:26:33,4,0,-0.5412,-1,-1,0.9966190476190476

Do you have any plans to make an endgame for singleplayer (or multiplayer)?

Multiplayer looks like the most promising aspect fo this game, will it be implemented at launch?

I was watching a let's play earlier and the guy was up to his 400th ship or some large number. It seems like the ship naming system could use some work. Are there plans to fix this in the near future? It would be a huge QOL improvement if the ships could be assigned to a trade route and then spawn new numbers like that. I wish I could iterate this better but I would be lying if I claimed I were intimately familiar with the mechanics, I will likely give more coherent answers in the future

12531,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts about the game

Game has potential.  I really enjoyed playing it.  A few of my thoughts that might make the game more enjoyable for others.

 The ai's still need tweaking I feel like.  I see them flying a lot of empty legs both to and from different planet's.  I look at the income chart for all the companies and I noticed that all the ai's at some point will make this same crash and burn.  They'll do nothing for longest while, then buy 20 ships, fly them empty and then go away for awhile.

The thing that bothered me the most was the reputation system.  I like the idea of it but in practice it seems like more of a headache.  I think it may need some tweaking so that it is less senstive to changes.  I feel like I gear up to start serving a planet and by the time I have the resources to actually make a difference, my reputation is almost zero and I can't  develope the planet at all.  This was a huge headache in my first real play through as my ability to leave the starting system was completely halted becuase my reputaion with the only plane that could get me out of system was zero.  Now I realize that's mostly my fault, but once it reached zero, I could not raise and keep it high enough to really do anything with the planet.  This basically limited me to the starting system.

Some things that came to my mind as I was playing that might make things more interesting:
-Get politics invovled (airlines get very political when it comes to slot space at airports, maybe not every planet can sustain a massive space port?)
-Board room disputes would be a cool and different way to go, this can also lead into mergers, acquisitions and hostile takeovers.
-Maybe try to add a terrain like feature?  Maybe strange anomolies that aren't understood block certain routes in space, maybe even a black hole that you have to navigate around.
-A rocket capable of interstellar travel would be pretty handy, don't know if I never made it that far in the game, but there were moments that would have been nice to have.
-If you sell a ship don't just delete the cargo but have it off loaded on the planet it is at
-Just like how you can schedule a ship to be sold, do the same with the change chargo loadout function

12532,InterstellarTransport,"36 hours in - suggestions and bugs I came across

First of all I want to say that I really enjoy this game so far.

So in one game earth settled a planet in another (far away) star system. I couldnt reach it with any of the ships available. Year 2066 - Doeing49, Gorman Starchaser and Spacebus D530 can't reach it. So how got it settled in the first place? ;) Am I supposed to subsidize a colony in between? That doesn't feel right. Later that game the KHI Byeolwamul also wasn't able to reach it.
I had another bug where I could order a interstellar starship (KHI) but it kept saying ""waiting for dilithium fuel"" although I had 1k+ on the same planet.

I think it's known that the order ship button bugs out quite often. It seems that sometimes when you try to order a ship and the massage ""spaceport to small"" pops up and you keep the window for purchasing ships open - while upgrading the spaceport (or messing with the un/loading options of a route) it CAN bug out. Although I just tried to reproduce this bug and it worked just fine so idk. 

When you have the small window of a ship open - and it arrives at a spacepot the display shows -0,00$ profit.

Suggestions:
Tooltips when you hover over the small buttons of the small window when you have a ship selected (I wanted to suggest that you add a ""clone ship"" button to that window only to find out it already exists XD
Arrow keys for switching through colonized planets.
Don't allow settlements in other star systems before any dilithium fuel is produced.
Add the option to silence ""pling"" of an arriving ship. (I want to hear the sound of a femine / new colony / new ship ect.) 

Edit:
Some questions: What does the ""player difficulty"" setting change?
What seating do colonist prefer? Seems like they fly first class in the begining of the game but later they want to fly coach class?

12533,InterstellarTransport,"Ship upgrade idea

Hi guys,

Was wondering if there was any plans to implement customization for the ships? I know you can upgrade to a different ship, but I was thinking more along the lines of keeping the same ships, and adding ""modules"" or something to improve it's stats, e.g. adding a better Engine or Thrusters to increase speed, more efficient Fuel converters so that it costs less fuel per run, increased cargo capacity, add a Warp drive, etc. 

Obviously there would still need to be limits to ships, like the 1st generation of ships can only be upgraded so much, like they can only have up to Rank 2 modules... This would also open up things like requiring machinery on planets that are fully upgraded if they have a specific building on the planet, which would be required to perform such upgrades.

Just some food for thought :)

1. a search feature. (if there is one already, i haven't found it) i have several events for Pleione 3 in my event log and i still have no damn clue where that even is.

2.  the thing that the goods type filter view (controls on the bottom right) does, but organized in a spreadsheet table.

this window should show all planets (one planet for each row). then we would able to filter for a cargo type. 

the columns would then show for each planet row:

- amount of the cargo type available

- amount of the cargo type produced/consumed weekly

- amount of the cargo type  delivered/picked up weekly (average over a selectable time frame)

- amount of the cargo type  combined produced/consumed and delivered/picked up. if the planet produced 10 excess cargo type and we trade 15 away, this column would read `-5`

 this is the column where we decide which ships to send to a different route.

 if this number is very negative, we know we need to haul more of the selected cargo type to the planetoid on this row.

 if this number is very positive, we can look in the third column if we are delivering cargo unnecessarily, or use this planet as a source for the selected cargo type.

while very spreadhsheety, this view would be much better than having to go to each of the green planets  to determine which one needs water the most urgently.

a luxury bonus would be an additional column where the time until the amount available on the planetoid reaches 0 is predicted.",2017-10-17 19:33:39,3,0,0.9388,1,1,1.0

12540,InterstellarTransport,"Thoughts on the game

Hi there,  certainly enjoy the game.  Both the concept and design are fun for me.

With that being said, there are some things I'm wondering about, some quality of life improvements I'd love to see. I know the dev team are working hard, and just wanted to say thanks and give a few ideas at this stage of development.

1. Planet list needed - It gets frustrating having to go to each and every colony to check on how they are doing and what they need or are full up on.  Having a list that can be sorted by things such as system, demand, extra, and so on would be quite helpful.

2. Traveler queue - The traveler queue, while a neat idea to have in its current form, it ends up being hard to figure out how many folks are waiting to go places sometimes.  Not to mention that if there's a huge queue, as Earth often gets when there's lots of new colonies, I literally can't even see how many folks are waiting if they are too far back in the queue.  I think having a list here, and maybe with certain details such as an average wait time per colonist (I know colonist wait time affects planetary reputation), # of colonists/business/tourist travelers, and then demand for seat type on the ships would be nice.

3. Waiting for dilithium fuel - I've had a problem with this where I have a fair number of colonies developing in a new system.  What I've found is that if I start producing fuel in that system, then even though ships had been going to and from the other planets just fine before, they now just sit there waiting for fuel until I send it from the one fuel producing planet.  If the ship is on a planet without fuel, and it has enough to make it back to its destination, can it just go there perhaps?

4. Waiting for full load after changing ship's route - Similar to #3, I've found that after changing a ship to a new route, if it's shipping water for instance, and it's supposed to have a full load from one planet and then take it to another planet, if the next planet it lands on won't let it fill up then it just sits there forever until I notice and manually tell it to stop and then start again.  It usually flies after that happens.  (example: Ship 1 is going from planet A to planet B shipping water from A to B.  While en route to planet B I decide it needs to change routes so that it‚Äôs shipping water from planet A to planet C.  It then lands on planet B, unloads its water, and won‚Äôt fly again because it can‚Äôt fill up with water on planet B.)

5. Earth founds new colonies way too fast sometimes - I've found that Earth founds tons of new colonies and there's no way for me to keep up and manage getting them all up and running.  The pace before interstellar travel opens up is fast, but I was able to manage pretty well and kept shortages to a minimum. However, Earth then started founding new colonies before I even had access to interstellar ships in the first place.  They would then found new colonies on the regular and not seem to care that I couldn't support them.  The other 2 companies in my game weren't doing that great.  One was liquidated and the other has yet to get interstellar ships after nearly 100 years of gameplay.  As the only company trying to support colonization, I just had to let a bunch of colonies die.  Trying to support them ended up costing me money on a colony that died off anyway.

6. I think it's unfortunate that upgrading planets is almost entirely punitive unless it's the spaceport - Every planetary upgrade costs a bunch of money and also hurts your reputation with that planet.  Further, many of the upgrades can help your competitors a bunch as well.  As my one game that I've played for quite some time didn't really have any competition and is largely a sandbox now, I don't know how it plays out long-term with competition in the mix.  But at this point I would expect that if I'm spending tons of money to improve the industry on a planet that I'd get some amount of bonus for that.  Like having the option to get a certain share of the new goods put into my own hangar perhaps?  Not harming reputation for all improvements?  I don't know the right answer here, but it just feels strange that investing in a planet would hurt so much.

Again, just some of my thoughts on the game.  I‚Äôm enjoying the game and think it has a lot of potential.  Thanks for all the hard work!

If anyone wants to discuss, I‚Äôll try checking this thread again soon.

Loving this game so far after about 10 hours of gameplay, but I have some qualms about reputation.
When building an office, upgrading one, or even demolishing one, my reputation on that planet takes a 3-7% dip.  Is this intended?  Shouldn't building or upgrading an office boost your reputation?
In my last game I erroneously thought that offices would stack (tool tip clearly states they don't :/ ).  So I demolished the second small office on earth leaving the original large office, but those two 'office transactions' made my reputation dive almost 10% on earth, leaving my transports waiting forever to load up machinery.  It was almost game breaking, but I eventually recovered by focusing on clearing my passenger queue on earth.

Hi guys,

Just been going through my old ships and upgrading them, wasn't quite expecting to be able to do so this much...

Initial ship was a Spacebus D520, clicked on ""Upgrade Ship"" and then changed some of the cargo slot items, whilst at the same time clicking between planets to determine the best supply/demand for each resource. When I was reducing the water slots, I noticed that as I removed points it wasn't updating the visual underneath, but the number at the side was in fact changing. I tried adding Water and it let me do so, and with Machinery, up until the value stopped increasing, and the image above is what I ended up with.

12545,InterstellarTransport,"Struggling to find Saved Games, and issue buying certain ships

Hi guys, just struggling with a few bits here - though it's probably me being thick!

Trying to find a save in the list is difficult, plus it doesn't seem to show all of my saves. The auto-save feature seems to create a new file for each save, as I have about 70+ in the list and I'm only on my 3rd attempt not to go bankrupt, haha. In any case, my latest save I did manually before going offline for a moment, and now it doesn't seem to be in the list. Where do these files save on my machine, and would it do any harm if I deleted the ones that I don't need?

Secondly, in my most recent playthrough I was at a point where I could buy the Khi Geodaehan ship, and had enough cash to do so! I had upgraded the Spaceport on Earth to 11, Luna was at 8, and Titan was at 8. I determined it's cargo hold, and selected ""Launch Immediately"", ""Luna Titan Direct"" as the route, and ""Earth"" as the delivery location. Normally I don't have any issues with buying ships like this, but no matter how many times I choose ""Order Ship"", it doesn't go through. Any pointers as to what I'm doing wrong?

Aside from those quirks, loving the game so far. Bought it on Thursday and haven't been able to put it down! Great work guys, keep it up!

Hey guys and girls

Project Interstellar was launched by three like minded friends interested in crypto. After the launch of Binance smartchain we saw the huge potential this market had by allowing deployment of smart contracts with little fees. It was distressing to see how the platform was being used to scam young investors. Therefore we are set on a mission to create our own community to introduce and educate people about the world of crypto and DeFi.

Time Capsule Protocol is the first generation token launched by Project Interstellar. It aims to bring new people into crypto trading by providing a reliable token to trade with. Due to the low market cap and the tokenomics behind the token itself, it has the potential to show significant increase in price and volume. Join us and plant a time capsule for tomorrow.

The galactic module heist is complete! Courtesy of your local invader mechanics your engine, reactor and hyperdrive modules have all been relegated to the scrap heap and removed from you ships. Ships will now always have these characteristics baked into the hull, therefore you will no longer need to enable the reactor, engines and hyperdrive.

Future updates may allow you to augment these hull characteristics with the additions of your own modules when we get that far!

Unfortunately, the heist might not be without a hitch, due to a number of changes being necessary there may be a few bugs caused, do let us know if you notice anything untoward. -  FYI: you may have to online/offline a module to force the ship to update",2020-01-01 16:18:33,2,0,0.4968,1,1,1.0

12598,InterstellarWar,"Update - 06/02/2019 - Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff

**Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Sometime in the next week we will be deploying our first pass of Building 2.0.   Building 2.0 is a major change to how Building works in Interstellar War.  We have added additional types of buildings and mechanics that introduce elements of strategic resource management and opens new strategies for building. 

&#x200B;

Please review this document for additional information [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing)  

Once it is live, I look forward to feedback and suggestions. 

&#x200B;

**Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Upon deploying Building 2.0, it is my intention to freeze personal credits and minerals to the values your currently have, and for the near-mid future remove the cost of ships and buildings. 

Personal ships will be docked and locked down for the duration of the Unlimited free stuff.    Freely purchased ships cannot be parked and will be removed at the end of this period of testing.  The exact plan for buildings at the end of this period is being determined but will be communicated and discussed. 

The time investment required to grind for minerals to build and the pain of losing that time, combined with the cost of ships and loss of time when they are destroyed, has helped create a bit of a gridlock with regards to planetary combat.

For the time being I want to remove the Mineral grind from the equation while we focus our efforts elsewhere.  

In order to balance the upcoming  Building 2.0, fleet combat, and planetary assaults, I need to encourage a faster feedback loop, and minimize the current propensity for hoarding and avoidance of conflict.  Buildings will cost no minerals, and ships will be free.

My hope is that this will encourage factions and players to engage where they otherwise would not.

I am extremely interested to get feedback on this potential shakeup, so let it rip. ",2019-02-06 20:34:44,1,0,0.3918,1,1,1.0

Ships will now always have these characteristics baked into the hull, therefore you will no longer need to enable the reactor, engines and hyperdrive.

Future updates may allow you to augment these hull characteristics with the additions of your own modules when we get that far!

Unfortunately, the heist might not be without a hitch, due to a number of changes being necessary there may be a few bugs caused, do let us know if you notice anything untoward. -  FYI: you may have to online/offline a module to force the ship to update",2020-01-01 16:18:33,2,0,0.4968,1,1,1.0
12611,InterstellarWar,"Update - 06/02/2019 - Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff

**Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Sometime in the next week we will be deploying our first pass of Building 2.0.   Building 2.0 is a major change to how Building works in Interstellar War.  We have added additional types of buildings and mechanics that introduce elements of strategic resource management and opens new strategies for building. 

&#x200B;

Please review this document for additional information [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing)  

Once it is live, I look forward to feedback and suggestions. 

&#x200B;

**Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Upon deploying Building 2.0, it is my intention to freeze personal credits and minerals to the values your currently have, and for the near-mid future remove the cost of ships and buildings. 

Personal ships will be docked and locked down for the duration of the Unlimited free stuff.    Freely purchased ships cannot be parked and will be removed at the end of this period of testing.  The exact plan for buildings at the end of this period is being determined but will be communicated and discussed. 

The time investment required to grind for minerals to build and the pain of losing that time, combined with the cost of ships and loss of time when they are destroyed, has helped create a bit of a gridlock with regards to planetary combat.

For the time being I want to remove the Mineral grind from the equation while we focus our efforts elsewhere.  

In order to balance the upcoming  Building 2.0, fleet combat, and planetary assaults, I need to encourage a faster feedback loop, and minimize the current propensity for hoarding and avoidance of conflict.  Buildings will cost no minerals, and ships will be free.

My hope is that this will encourage factions and players to engage where they otherwise would not.

I am extremely interested to get feedback on this potential shakeup, so let it rip. ",2019-02-06 20:34:44,1,0,0.3918,1,1,1.0

Dr. Strange has just put in an update for ship speed, please offline/online any module on your ship and the speed will be corrected. Please note, he noticed that the skill bonus for piloting was being incorrectly applied per engine so ships with 2 engines will be slower than pre this update, they will look at either adjusting the base speeds or other ways of adjusting these.",2020-01-01 16:31:21,1,0,0.743,1,1,1.0
12630,InterstellarWar,"Update - 06/02/2019 - Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff

**Building 2.0 and Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Sometime in the next week we will be deploying our first pass of Building 2.0.   Building 2.0 is a major change to how Building works in Interstellar War.  We have added additional types of buildings and mechanics that introduce elements of strategic resource management and opens new strategies for building. 

&#x200B;

Please review this document for additional information [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1776P73arDWbvSQdfE8AFId62LhqFyxnNDx4T88UoxTc/edit?usp=sharing)  

Once it is live, I look forward to feedback and suggestions. 

&#x200B;

**Unlimited Free Stuff** 

Upon deploying Building 2.0, it is my intention to freeze personal credits and minerals to the values your currently have, and for the near-mid future remove the cost of ships and buildings. 

Personal ships will be docked and locked down for the duration of the Unlimited free stuff.    Freely purchased ships cannot be parked and will be removed at the end of this period of testing.  The exact plan for buildings at the end of this period is being determined but will be communicated and discussed. 

The time investment required to grind for minerals to build and the pain of losing that time, combined with the cost of ships and loss of time when they are destroyed, has helped create a bit of a gridlock with regards to planetary combat.

For the time being I want to remove the Mineral grind from the equation while we focus our efforts elsewhere.  

In order to balance the upcoming  Building 2.0, fleet combat, and planetary assaults, I need to encourage a faster feedback loop, and minimize the current propensity for hoarding and avoidance of conflict.  Buildings will cost no minerals, and ships will be free.

My hope is that this will encourage factions and players to engage where they otherwise would not.

I am extremely interested to get feedback on this potential shakeup, so let it rip. ",2019-02-06 20:34:44,1,0,0.3918,1,1,1.0
