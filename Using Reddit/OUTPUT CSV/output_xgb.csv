title they all decided to build in the neighboring superpowers territory and i want to have a more centralized economy rather than having to import from the literal other side of the map i mined all the asteroids in my territory to fund my war machine  of course i could always invade them but sadly im actually in a position where even if i wanted to i couldnt i dont want to invade them btw

 i do not yet have an economy strong enough to wage a war against three factions and my campaigns against bandit controlled area and the alghat of my custom universe are already taking a toll",-0.7686,-1,-1

i have many more that i cycle through the week but those are my daily ones that keep me level  and the best is gavin keeps coming up with more amazing blends i have yet to try some of them but overall depending of what youre looking for to help you with youll most probably find something

"the interstellar paradox cooper and tars were ‚Äúthey‚Äù all along

in interstellar they are initially thought to be advanced beings guiding humanity however cooper‚Äôs realization‚Äîthey didnt bring us here we brought ourselves‚Äîsuggests something far more mindbending cooper and tars are ‚Äúthey‚Äù

the theory mine

 timeline   the origin

cooper and tars enter the black hole
due to extreme time dilation they remain trapped for millennia over time they evolve or discover how to manipulate higher dimensions they create the tesseract allowing their past selves to escape



 timeline   the intervention

cooper and tars place the tesseract inside gargantua they interact with their past selves cooper and tars guiding them out this sacrifices timeline  ensuring the loop continues



 a selfsustaining time loop

every version of cooper and tars relies on a previous iteration to survive there were never any ‚Äúhigher beings‚Äù helping‚Äîjust future versions of themselves ensuring the cycle perpetuates

why this makes sense
it resolves the bootstrap paradox the knowledge comes from a past cooper who spent eons inside the black hole

it aligns with the movie‚Äôs core theme time is a physical dimension that humans can manipulate

the quote supports it ‚Äúwe brought ourselves‚Äù suggests no divine intervention‚Äîjust humanity guiding itself

in essence cooper and tars aren‚Äôt just surviving the loop‚Äîthey are the loop",0.6458,1,1

interstellar was released in  and at that point of time i was at such location that the nearest cinema hall was  kms away the travelling itself involved a lot of hurdles 

after that time i have managed to watch the film many times on television on nf and prime video i am so in love with the movie that i bought a k bluray and watched it on my tv many times at my home i always had this pain that i could not watch such a great story in the cinema 

this year though as luck would have it i finally watched it yesterday on the biggest possible screen besides although the spectacular visuals and music i have always loved this film for sharing a great bond between a father and a daughter i am always tearing up when they start playing stay  years of messages and you were my ghost the last scene  because my dad promised me is beautiful culmination of the arc between murph and cooper

im sure this has been hashed out many times before on this sub but i dont get what the big deal is it was a pretty cool movie and the docking scene was very good but nothing about it seemed groundbreaking or mind blowing

the thing from outer space

all players begin the game unarmed grouped in twos and threes around the map one players spawns as the thing



setup

players spawn in twos and threes around the various parts of the facility players achieve victory by defeating the thing one player is informed that he is the thing he achieves victory once all players are eliminated or have been infected and finish gestating into more of the thing



play

players begin with several chores objectives they must complete as part of their research on the station completing a chore will bring a reward such as extra medical equipment extra weapons a backup generator etc as prerequisite chores are completed new chores are awarded until all the prerequisite chores are completed you do not know which chores are coming up damage to certain systems will make some chores impossible and you may eventually run out of possible chores by this fact



the thing

the thing is an alien lifeform that can take the shape of living creatures the thing starts as helpless as any other human and remains indistinguishable from other during its gestation period of several minutes after its gestation completes the creature gains superhuman endurance and the ability to infect other players




environmental interactivity

youre trapped in a station with various systems that can be activateddeactivateddestroyed the medical lab can be set up to test your blood for the infection a player must perform several timeintensive tasks in the medical lab to set up the experiment then players blood can be tested the radio station can be used to call for help tricking the hapless responders into permitting the creature to escape sets a countdown timer after which the creature wins if it has not been eliminated the infirmary can stabilize players whove been heavily injured and are bleeding out but it can be locked damaged or destroyed must be damageddestroyed from the inside the power can be destroyed slowly freezing the humans to death they can win by destroying the creature before their time expires the armory can be lockedunlockeddestroyed and keys distributed players begin unarmed and defenseless but a variety of weapons are available some simply kill things a limited few can reveal the creatures nature if it is adequately injured if enough chores are completed a preventative vaccine can be created in the medical lab if it still exists or the entire station may be selfdestructed resulting in an automatic victory for the scientists over the thing





communication

players may communicate by radio visor down or facetoface visor up radio communications are audible to all players including the thing facetoface communication is limited in range and works as demonstrated in the interstellar marines audio occlusion demo players wishing to plot in secret or who wish to voice suspicions in private will have to use facetoface communication requiring physical proximity



weaponry

most weapons begin locked in the armory the armory begins unlocked but may be locked unlocked and destroyed in addition to weapons which may be used to kill regularly the armory also includes a few flamethrowers which reveal when a player is the thing if they do adequate damage or are used on a corpse additional flamethrowers and ammunition may be obtained by completing chores





infection and gestation

the thing can infect players once it finishes gestating infection is a harmless no damage process which takes place instantaneously there is a very clear animation that shows when the thing is infecting someone so it is best to infect players alone and from behind a player will not know he has been infected if he does not see himself get infected once a player is infected he immediately begins gestating

gestation takes several minutes and occurs in three phases in the first phase the player cannot be distinguished from other players by any means including a blood test onethird of the way through gestation the player reaches the acute infection point after which blood tests will confirm that the player is infected twothirds of the way through infection the player reaches the critical point once a player reaches the critical point he is notified that he is infected and his vision changes slightly to show him that he is infected once gestation completes the player is the thing and can infect other players



victory

the scientists win by defeating the thing and killing any infected players the thing wins by killing all scientists

players who have been infected but have not finished gestating count as scientists any infected player who dies before gestation completes wins and loses with the scientists thus a player who has reached the critical point of gestation knows he must be killed but is faced with the dilemma of whether he wants to win with the players or with the thing

"interstellar may be perfect

i recently watched interstellar with my girlfriend in the theaters and i realised the movie is even better than i had previously known it to be
one of the flaws that come up for this movie is the anne hathaway scene where she says

love is the one thing were
capable of perceiving that
transcends dimensions of time
and space 

and often i have seen people
criticize this scene because it feels like anne hathaway is spelling out the message of the film breaking the show dont tell rule however im here to argue that interstellar doesnt do that and that this take and interpretation subjective as cinema is is in my opinion wrong
if im not mistaken the context of the scene is that
brand rom and coop have very little fuel due to the fiasco on millers planet so they have to
choose between dr mann or wolf edmunds 

coop is holding the debate and as scientists they are only allowing scientific and objective reasons to chart to either destinations dr brand loves wolf edmunds and besides that she has no objective or real reason to vouch for wolfs planet so she makes love sound all scientific and objective with the love transcends all barriers of space and dimension quote

its a human being whos hit by the possibility of death her own ailing father the death of a teammate on millers planet and the fact that due to relativity dr miller died minutes before they arrived even though she left years ago which means if they hurry amelia might get to see wolf
once again

she is desperately making a case for wolf edmunds planet and making love sound all
scientific and objective so she can convince rom and coop to let her see edmunds once more
before she or he die in this distant galaxy

extractors can now be told to stop mining and dump the remaining resources into space you can also tell the extractor to mine a resource out of a rock out of order so you can skip straight to the gold or platinum it doesnt appear to have any ties to automation cards so this will require manual operation  
the refinery has a new feature where you can set the target value higher than the total resources in the refinerys buffer so long as theres some of the raw resources needed in the buffer the refinery will keep mining until the target value is reached doesnt this allow you to skip on using automation cards for refineries sort of if the you fall behind a bit and the buffer runs out the refinery will stop and will not attempt to start up again later an automation card will prompt the refinery to keep busy the automation card also enables the refinery to handle multiple types of resources  
also coming next patch automation cards for the cargo teleporters   
httpsclipstwitchtvminiatureexpensiveaubergineallenhuhuhttpsclipstwitchtvminiatureexpensiveaubergineallenhuhu  
fairly straightforward you can select nearby ships as destinations even select vaults as a destination apparently the card somehow tracks the steam id to ensure it goes to the right persons vault apparently it even remembers the settings if you go out of range of the other ship though it sounds like if the ship rifts to another system and rifts back it breaks   


a match speed to target function is coming actually two functions one matches your ships speed to the current speed of the target the other tries to keep your ships speed in sync with the target even if the target changes speed they attempted to show this off in the steam its not quite finished yet it makes the ships go a speed just not the speed they actually want to go theyre getting there

   you cant buy mining laser and adv mining laser anymore or they just changed the buying shop it was on refinery before this is bad for me haulerh miner is actually really good

 interface layout
   the cargo trade and equipment screen is much neater and easier to navigate pretty good especially if you have something specific to buy and dont want to waste time pressing arrow buttons to look at every cargo

 mercenary ai
   a nice addition helps for station attacks pretty cheap too only if there were more of them

 autopilot orders
   the repair to nearest order is a nice touch it saves time maybe next update dev should add scavenge patrol and explore commands

 friend bar glitch
   this is a glitch i think it isnt meant to be added that i found where the friendliness meter exceeds the maximum this actually is a big help since they give really good prices theres one station where every equipment upgrade costs  credits one of the shipyards sells arms factory parts for  thousand cr and buys them back for  million cr

disclaimer  
 im no math expert i was watching those millers planet in realtime video and realised no one has ever tried to do an accurate timelapse for comparison so i decided to do it myself  
 a lot of factors are unclear movie cutting magic estimated numbers etc so dont expect  accuracy in this calculation whatever i used from the wiki movies information and assumed i did state so  
 biggest thanks to this man for doing a timelapse for  years i couldnt find any timelapse that goes beyond  years so his video was my only option his video httpsyoutubepzyqewwphksiszlelqmafcwtehttpsyoutubepzyqewwphksiszlelqmafcwte  
 if you find any mistakes feel free to point them out and correct them my brain is fried after making this lol  
  
millers planet is divided into  segments  
 start  minutes  seconds  
 timeskip  minutes  seconds  
 end  seconds  
total of  minutes  seconds  
  
based on wiki the time they spent on millers planet is  hours  minutes minus the normal realtime segments the real duration of the timeskip segment should be  hours  minutes  seconds so now we have  
 start  minutes  seconds  
 timeskip  hours  minutes  seconds speeding up rate of  times thats a long talk   
 end  seconds  
  
based on wiki again the real time they spent on millers planet is  years  months  days around  years using the  month   days average converting the  segments into years in realtime using the  second on millers planet   day on earth conversion rate  hour on millers   years on earth  
 start  year feb   dec   
 timeskip  years dec   may   
 end  year may   june   
they entered millers planet in  which is not a leap year after  years they exit millers planet in june  based on wiki which is also not a leap year so the calculation for both start and end segments will use  daysyear for the timeskip segment just do        years  
  
the man took selfies for  years  years old assuming this was exactly  years his video is  minutes  seconds  
so  years would be  minutes  seconds  years old i trimmed away the last  seconds of his video to match  
that would mean in realtime  year   seconds in his video  
now we split his video into  segments to match with millers planets segments  
 start  seconds  
 timeskip  minutes  seconds  
 end s  
  
now to speed up or slow down the selfie segments to match with millers planet segments we have the ratio of  
 start  seconds into  minutes  seconds slow down selfie video by  times  
 timeskip  minutes  seconds into  minutes  seconds speed up selfie video by  times

"interstellar sequel idea grok edition

i asked grok x ai to write a sequel for the movie  interstellar  this is what grok came back with  


heres a concise pitch for a sequel to interstellar building on the originals themes and story



title interstellar beyond the veil

premise decades after cooper‚Äôs mission through the wormhole humanity thrives on edmunds‚Äô planet now called new earth amelia brand nearing the end of her life has spearheaded a fragile but growing colony however a mysterious signal‚Äîdecoded as a warning‚Äîemanates from the black hole gargantua hinting at an imminent threat tied to the beings who placed the wormhole cooper presumed lost in the tesseract reemerges on new earth aged only slightly due to time dilation claiming he‚Äôs been sent back with a mission to lead a team into gargantua itself

plot cooper reunites with his nowelderly daughter murph‚Äôs descendants who‚Äôve advanced gravitational tech based on her equations the signal suggests the wormhole‚Äôs creators are either faltering‚Äîor abandoning humanity to a cosmic fate a new crew including cooper a skeptical young pilot named lila murph‚Äôs greatgranddaughter and a sentient ai evolved from tars ventures into gargantua‚Äôs event horizon inside they encounter a fractured reality where time and space collapse into a labyrinth of human memories and alternate futures they discover the beings were never aliens but an advanced human civilization from a distant timeline now unraveling due to their own hubris in manipulating black holes

conflict the team must decide whether to repair the beings‚Äô failing system‚Äîrisking their own existence‚Äîor sever the connection potentially stranding humanity without further aid lila clashes with cooper over his blind faith in the mission while the ai grapples with its own emerging consciousness meanwhile new earth faces escalating gravitational anomalies threatening the colony‚Äôs survival

climax inside gargantua cooper confronts a vision of murph who urges him to let go of the past the team sacrifices the ai to stabilize the black hole allowing new earth a fighting chance cooper stays behind to ensure the fix holds vanishing into the singularity as lila escapes with the crew

ending new earth endures now truly on its own lila inspired by cooper‚Äôs sacrifice vows to chart humanity‚Äôs future without shortcuts a final shot reveals a faint new signal‚Äînot from the wormhole but from an uncharted corner of the galaxy hinting at the next chapter



this sequel keeps the emotional core of family and survival ramps up the cosmic stakes and explores humanity‚Äôs next step into the unknown what do you think‚Äîwant me to expand any part",-0.9136,-1,-1

interstallar blends saved my life after brain surgery 

october  i underwent the pinacle of brain surgery having a meningioma removed from my brain stem my spinal cord was almost completely pinched off from the tumor i had been having headaches from hell and numbness in my limbs went to a dr and told them i was pretty sure i had a tumor and pointed to where he dismissed it as tension headaches common to women and tried to throw steroids and muscle relaxers at me fast forward a few months after  nights of no sleep and entire body clenched from the pain i went to the er they rushed me for tests discovered the tumor and scheduled surgery for the next day the operation went perfect and i was on cloud  just to be alive for  month i honestly wondered if they had knicked something and left me a little special because the vibrancy of life was beautifully overwhelming so many humble happy tears  until one day it was like a dark cloud crashed on me and i all of a sudden had overwhelming anxiety and depression and those tears turned to hopelessness   for months i resisted using pharma to treat the symptoms of a tbi from surgery it was so tempting and i almost caved but i didnt i couldnt leave my bed without being overwhelmed with a wave of anxiety and overwhelm trying to take me out and would run back to fetal position pray for help and try to replace each rancid thought id try to get up again and catch up but i just couldnt no matter how hard i tried i closed out the world sent my children away with family it was pure hell 

i discovered gavins blends and my hope was peaked while reading the testimonials so i reached out for recommendations and was told to try trinity and rewire i am forever grateful to god and gavin for these blends as my anxiety lessened i started to feel more like myself again the depression and darkness loosened its grip gradually until  day it was just not there anymore itd been a struggle financially to catch back up and so there were a few months that i couldnt afford the blends the anxiety and overwhelm came back with a vengeance and i knew i had to fight through to somehow get more blends asap my body was crying out for them within a couple days of starting the blends back up i was back to good and the anxiety and depression were replaced with calm gratitude and steady focus before it was like my thought process would just evaporate or fall off a cliff and id have zero recollection of conversations or my points that all stopped with the blends  amazing i went from hanging on by a thread to having clarity peace and joy again
 
i also used gavins sabertooth for tooth and gum pain that had became pretty consistent i made a toothpaste and also took it i have had zero pain in my teeth or gums since that  sample  

i am forever grateful for these blends and the powerful natural medicinals contained therein i am so grateful for gavin for seeing it through and also to those who left their testimonials

"adhd destroyed full focus  clarity with  interstellar plan

i recently experienced an incredible journey with autonomous rewire and trinity paired with deep meditation i believe i reached the ultimate state of zen during this process i felt as though i was in a deep sleep and even achieved astral projection i vividly saw myself sleeping with my hands glowing in vibrant multicolored transparency i floated around my house and even observed my dad sleeping it was an awesome experience‚Äîuntil i encountered some things i wasnt quite prepared for during my second attempt

  


in previous discussions with my group we explored these topics extensively and i want to emphasize the importance of being spiritually ready for such experiences i am truly grateful for gavins work he is incredibly dedicated and outworks everyone out there after just two days of using autonomous i feel like ive returned to  hustle‚Äîmy focus and motivation are at an alltime high

  


autonomous has been a gamechanger for managing my adhd nothing else has worked as effectively for me however i urge everyone to know their limits when it comes to practices like astral projection and lucid dreaming¬†

  


overall i highly recommend autonomous for anyone seeking to enhance their mental clarity and spiritual growth thank you gavin for your amazing work

while reading comments regarding pets i read a comment about this idea  assuming that blight hasnt affected sea life could there be underwater farms that could provide sustenance  i myself have grown microgreens at home and ive read that modern sailors do this  could sea life be farmed to feed a large number of people  are there renewable things in the sea that grow very quickly

"i wanted to repost my review from trustpilot because i spent quite some time writing it and i want it to be here as well the truth about interstellar blends and gavin personal experience

i have been on this journey with gavin since  and his blends absolutely changed my life



i found him through the trading community where some buddies of mine recommended me his trinity and nebula for trading and boy did it make a difference



i wanted my parents to get me some of his blends and upon inspection that my father did he said that gavin must be a scammer for there is no such thing as perfect reviews so they didnt buy the blends for me 



but i trusted my trading buddies and wanted to at least give the man a shot to see if it makes a difference 



i had to save up for a few months to get that  extra cash for  big bags of blends and i was praying that it will work since it was hard back then for me to get my hands on that much money 



after the two bags of nebula and trinity arrived in  days of fasting  blends genuinely eliminated my anxiety depression and tension and completely restructured my presence i had severe adhd and  of tsp of trinity and nebula made me present here and now



 months later i had my first profitable trading month in forex



note its not the blends that make you successful but they are the key to easier achievement



i could never trade and study h per day everyday for  months and put in the work without the blends 



and if you think that is amazing it was just the beginning after hitting my first k month at age of  i got myself a shit ton of blends and later down the line when his list of blends expanded i am buying minimum of  different blends every single time



not only that but i also had epilepsy and i started to reject the poisonous pills that doctors gave me which had literally infinite negatives and only one potential positive



with alz lutein apigenin i have not had any more seizures tho i believe there is more to it than blends gavin also got me on ketogenic diet  fasting one  day dry fast per quarter and one  day dry   day water per year 



i have studied epilepsy and seizures and made a huge leap for myself  years seizure free and got my drivers license now thanks to blends diet lifestyle changes and mindset  i also helped a few others do the same 



in the other review i forgot to mention that i am adrenaline addict and i do a lot of extreme sports nebula autonomous trinity rewire and antifatigue have helped me push the limits of the sports i am in and i also gave the blends to my friends who went nuts for them 



the blends work like a charm but they are not magic if you think you can drink alcohol eat junk food watch adult content and scroll social media and have the blends cope for all the negatives you are mistaken blends are enhancers boosters rewards for correct behavior not magic pill do your part and the blends will do theirs



needless to say gavins interstellar blends are a big part of my life for the past  years and will continue to be



for anyone thinking that his products are too expensive i say find me someone who offers even remotely close products and also ask yourself how bad is your mindset that you are putting a price on your wellbeing and health



if anyone has any doubts about what i wrote reach out to me if you have any questions reach out anything at all just reach out i am willing to help and give you a live testimony with more depth and more instructions telegram twitter instagram whatever look up my name or handle ugiustix will vouch for gavin any day



i already went on for too long but you would as well if something literally changed your life and you see people hating on the guy that is helping thousands become selfactualized gavin answers questions helps you out in dms if you just ask 



but yes it is true he will not tollerate weak excuse making people 



here in the interstellar blends community we strive to be excellent to make the best version of ourselves and not compromise with anything we break limits we move mountains and we work together 



super community super gavin super us

"watched interstellar yesterday after  years and it‚Äôs still unmatched

i just watched interstellar again for its th anniversary rerelease in imax in india and i have to say nothing has surpassed it in the past decade the sheer scale the emotional depth the science hans zimmer‚Äôs score and of course that mindblowing docking sequence it all still hits as hard as it did in  but i had the opportunity to watch it in imax this time

plenty of space movies have come since and nothing was so immersive and emotional as interstellar it hasn‚Äôt aged in the slightest

a decade later i still get emotional when cooper watches murph‚Äôs messages when they escape from miller‚Äôs planet and of course when ‚Äúno time for caution‚Äù kicks in

"what do you think makes the line because my dad promised me hit hard

this is how id put it myself

murph does say nobody believed me but i knew youd come back to make it clear but this line hits that home more so because it shows how thoroughly murphs faith in her father was renewed she ultimately believed in him and his promise despite that not making a difference for a lot of her life 

obviously the time displacement and him being her ghost played the biggest role but that renewed her faith that had been mostly absent she seemed to outright believe that he was never going to return yet what the th dimensional beings did for cooper resulted in his actions helping her to save humanity

therefore if that were possible returning was possible too and she held onto that memory of her father telling her that i think its more fitting than her saying because you promised me something about replacing that with my dad has a feeling of childhood that ties the three stages of murph together whilst also calling back to child murphs emotional distress and acting as a resolution to that plus my dad just emphasises the parental bond more",0.9728,1,1

i was introduced to these blends by my son two years ago our family was going through a health bout with mold toxicity i have tried so many of the blends over the last two years and i can say they have really brought back my health to where it was i was in a pretty weak state physically as were my kiddos fast forward two years later and i‚Äôm back to my job as a personal trainer feeling great gavin is great he is quick to respond when i asked all kinds of questions about what blends would help us with our health issues and we had many symptoms there are so many blending i continue to take daily and if i were to say a few that i absolutely love it would be gainz because i‚Äôm on my feet all day working working out with my clients it helps me maintain my strength and stamina i also really like trinity it gives me that peaceful feeling and keeps me calm and clear all day really can‚Äôt thank interstellar blends and gavin for these wonderful blends that brought my health back",0.9917,1,1

lone survivor
i kim haar j√∏rgensen the primary creative force behind interstellar marines am currently the only official developer working on the game i can do almost everything except programming which im learning 

to be able to pay the bills at home im currently working a full time job as respiratory handicap helper which is both day and night shifts allowing a fair amount of free time to work on interstellar marines

at the moment there is not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for interstellar marines except the ultra clear ambitious vision of what interstellar marines will be once fully realized some day

ill keep working on interstellar marines until i go crazy or die trying or preferably manage to recreate pickup maintain traction and conclude the games envisioned

update 
the next short term goal is to finally get update  out update  is centered mostly around expanding our combat sandbox arena called wargames and fixing as many of our bugs as possible you can check our trello pagetrellocom for progress and more details

in the long term the goals will be to get the game upgraded to unity  and make everything run smoother be much more bug free and prettier this will allow us to expand in more interesting directions to chum players in

its also a clear goal to make sure future updates although small will release more frequently

moving forward
lack of substantial progress in early access has resulted in a steady increase of negative reviews understandably which in turn have had a very serious effect on sales creating a nasty downward spiral to the bottom of the foodchain

with the current negative review scores it will be much more difficult to attract publishersinvestors to our game although we will certainly still try what‚Äôs more important is moving forward even if slowly and when things become more positive more options will become available

ill keep working on interstellar marines with awesome people interested in helping out thats for sure ive been very fortunate to get this small handful of awesome volunteer community members on board to help out from time to time i‚Äôm also blessed to have my brotherinarms zpsspectre helping out with game design military advisory and community interaction only time will tell how this crowd sourcing adventure will turn out 

i can totally respect if you could not care less about me or this game anymore it really has been too long a wait with way too little progress

if on the other hand you feel a sense of hope and power inside to keep fighting ill be honored and proud

show dont tell is what im judging myself on and this is just text back to work

 boosted low end significantly you should be able to easily tell
 lots of fixes after hunting down volume anomalies
 made the first half of no time for caution much more audible in the beginning uses less of day one dark but can easily still hear the best parts from both
 now using  lossless sources thanks to those who provided them to me this means a lot of my editing work was reworked from scratch to replace the lossy sources
 sounds fatterbiggerlouder like the rest of the ost
 ending has been tweaked to sound as close to perfect as possible
 all transitions are now accurate
 added piano transition from film version that goes before organ crescendo 
 all arpeggios are now way closer in the mix instead of being in the background and hard to hear
 proper dynamics have been realized for the guitarorgan starting at  
 string stem is easier to hear

note still no source for earlier vocals


version   

mp httpsmegaconzfygmqcismzaqurbbfpuylguzjrgjmrbxzhunopy


 added organ stems
 added grand piano extrabass stems fixed in 
 tweaked dynamics
 reworked the whole track volume reenforced more parts toward the beginning so the beginning will sound a lot fatter etc
 just made everything much bigger and better in general the way it would have sounded on the ost in the first place


notes about version 

i just had a few repeat viewings in imax to confirm a few things

 the vocals are not nearly as loud in the mix as previously thought it is nothing like they were in mountains they start earlier in the film version but i dont have a good enough source for me to use the vocals earlier so it will stay as is

 organ isnt as loud as previously thought either and i have based my arrangement on this there are still strings and other stems to acknowledge in the mix


version two


mp httpsmegaconztjzrtzbuypvlbacbhiyciijzlcfiuuyrphgsbaukuxy

added vocals



version one


mp httpsmegaconzhbbjisoqutevibfusibrfjnpzvizeolkgrthjzukablni

 louderfar less muddyremastered dynamics
 merged with source material from day one  dark can hear both recordings in the mix so the first half sounds a lot less horrible because of the obvious samples
 merged with ending from wormhole track for better dynamics
 second half of the track sounds less empty
 reenforced organguitar arpeggio in the middle of the track
 added experimental organstring part to carry the ending



this is an ongoing project and i need immediate feedback because i am still working on it and i will go as far as humanly possible to make this shit listenable posting many revisions until people are satisfied with it
organ stems at the end will be implemented next if you guys are okay with where progress is now",0.9923,1,1

hello

first off all im pretty new to ir
i think it would be a cool idea if you could build a battery station this station would be able tk create battery packs you can take the battery packs in your inventory store them on cargo pads or place them in another battery station
this would mean when creating a battery pack you will take stored power from that power group or give the extra power to a powergroup
to be able to add power to a battery station you need available space in batteries or powercells

i have been playing for a while now and my game has recently gone really good i had a few haulerh ships set to automatic trading and i was making a nice amount of money i wanted to expand though so i completely annihilated an entire hostile sector with asteroids in it and put a refinery and  haulerms there once i made some more money i got a hypersleep pod factory right next to my refinery the refinery was full of alloys and nanochips so full in fact the miners couldnt unload their cargo anymore so i put a haulerh on  jumps there and told it to trade the problem here is that it doesnt do anything it just there standing still finding trade route why wont it transport the alloys and nanochips to the factory

"in the first iteration of the endurance dr mann probably succeeded

not sure if this has come up before but upon watching interstellar a few times i was wondering how the future bulk beings humans survived in the first place

we know cooper was directed to nasa by himself but there had to be a first successful endurance mission without cooper

so brand doyle and romilly went on their own without cooper they probably took too much time from miller‚Äôs planet because cooper wasn‚Äôt there to have the plan to take the ranger back and forth

if after miller‚Äôs planet they colonized edmund‚Äôs planet that would be that they evolved and that‚Äôs where the future humans came from

but if they went to mann‚Äôs planet then dr mann‚Äôs plan probably would have worked and he would have succeeded given that tars let the autopilot succeed

so in another timeline or the first timeline he could have been the last person to survive the mission",0.9641,1,1

 later in game do you specialize your ships for example for convienience so you dont have to run miles around ship cost fuel coolant etc or to avoid potential cost of loosing said ship pvp

"changes to the event horizon isr server

isr  is launching on september th in an attempt to capitalize on the increased player traffic that the launch will hopefully bring there are going to be considerable changes to how event horizon httpeventhorizonsitehttpeventhorizonsite httpsdiscordggsqfmpshttpsdiscordggsqfmps operates this includes a full wipe of the main eh server though players wont necessarily be starting over with zero resources more details on that below

the goals of these changes are to encourage longer term player retention encourage more regular player interactions both pve and pvp interactions and to give long term goalsachievements for players and organizations 

these changes will include but are not necessarily limited to

‚Ä¢fewer star systems in the eh galaxy currently looking at about  useful systems in total

‚Ä¢a new central star system hadron that all players will start in

‚Ä¢limited resource spawns in the asteroid belts both of type and quantity

‚Ä¢seasons of pvp and pve though there will be one permanent pve star system and one permanent pvp star system

‚Ä¢addition of randomly spawning short lived asteroid fields same as the ones that spawn at npc mining stations note that these fields will have more than just t resources these will spawn in random locations encouraging players to seek them out and compete with other groups to mine them

‚Ä¢return of server events such as pvp tournaments but also pve events

‚Ä¢a new unique currency eventium on the server represented by a custom resource players can earn this currency in various ways including trading withstealing from other players players will be able to trade eventium in for other resources but they will also be able to use it to purchase custom stations purchase special services or use it to purchase resources after the wipes automated scripts will be in place to help with many of these eventium transactions which will hopefully allow it to be considerably more useful 

not all of these changes will be present on event horizon as soon as  launches and are subject to change based on what  adds and how many players eh can attract with the  launch the current eh server will continue as is until the th and will probably still be left online at least temporarily after the  launch the new server will simply take its place on the th

potentially frequently asked questions

why are you wiping the server i dont want to start over again

the server wipe does two things the first and primary reason is that it allows me to create a new isr server and work on setting it up over the next few weeks without needing to worry about preservingtransferringlosing player progress the second reason is that its encouraging for new players to know that everyone else on the server dont have a massive advantage over them and for many existing players its more engaging to have a fresh start 

that said i know starting completely over in isr can be a bit of a grind so starter packs will be given out to existing players based on how long theyve been on the discord if you left the discord and then came back later on ill still count it the exact amount and type of resources in the starter packs has yet to be decided but it will be based on the tier system  years equals t  year equals t  months equals t and anyone arriving before the launch of  will get some t resources more details on that can be found on the eh discord httpsdiscordggsqfmpshttpsdiscordggsqfmps leading up to the  launch

why are you having so few star systems other servers have hundreds

the huge number of star systems that isr spawns by default is actually a problem with isr even if you assume a server regularly has  players something that has never happened star systems in isr are already so enormous that you could put the full  players in a single star system remove signatures and transponders and it would be practically impossible to find another player even in vectron syx on popular servers the only time youll run into another player is when theyre back at hsc ic to rearmstore their ship the rest of the time players are scattered across the stars on a server with even  star systems pvp is practically impossible and even just trying to meet up with other players to trade withcrew with them is a chore   
having infinite star systems also equals infinite resources which completely removes any reason to interact with other players for resources why trade withfight with other players for resources when you can just as easily or even easier mine them yourself by finding a system with a high rating of your target resource

what special services  
good question i havent thought of very many at the moment it would be things like allowing players to rename planetsstars and to have the skrillfaction rating of a system adjusted im sure players will give me other ideas as we go forwards  
pvppve seasons  
this is an idea i acquired from other empyrion servers during that brief period where i hosted an emp server for eh apologies to those players who wanted such a server for longer it proved to be more effort than i was willing to give especially as empyrion was a game i didnt find very engaging  
the star systems on event horizon will cycle between majority pve and majority pvp toggle on a regular cycle if youre not interested in engaging in pvp you can still play on event horizon but pvp players will get bonus eventium and other rewards for beating other groups there will also be changes to encourage raids of other orgs stations during pvp seasons

  
after the wipes what wipes

this is the one change im not fully decided on im considering having the server wipe every so often with a handful of things carrying over like eventium im not fully convinced that the benefits of this outweigh the downsides but at minimum these wipes would only take place every  months at the minimum most likely even rarer

as a writer i thought romilly was a very wellused character  heres what i got from him

 romilly provides shock value when cooper and brand return to the ship to demonstrate the passage of  years  obvious enough

 of course romilly dies  people have to die occasionally to remind the audience of the danger to our heroes

 romilly spent some of his alonetime on the ship studying the black hole  they dont delve deep into this just skim past it mentioned twice  once before and once after ice planet but its entirely possible his research could have addedseeded the beginnings of future work that would in fact help future humansbuild a wormhole and place it near saturn for us to find  or to help us build a tesseract  he could have laid the foundations for himself to travel through the wormhole

 romilly triggers the booby trap  this lets the audience see just how fucked up dr mann was  while dr mann said words like im going to complete this mission for you  ill do it for you  in fact he longplanned the death of others to save his own ass  without that explosion its possible some audience members may have sympathized with mann  the preplanned detonation of a bomb eliminates any sympathy

 heres where romillys value really shines  he waits on a ship for  years  months and  hours  dr mann was alone on a planet for a few years     he couldnt stand the solitude nor his own inevitable death  dr mann says to cooper something like i hope you never know the pain of just needing to see another human for so long referring to his own  years alone  but romilly did exactly that for  years  months and  hours  romilly demonstrates just how strong a human soul can be while juxtaposing just how weak dr mann really was",-0.6963,-1,1

"timeline of interstellar

 donald cooper is born

 a wormhole is discovered orbiting around saturn

 joseph cooper is born

 thomas cooper is born

 february  tars goes haywire in coopers ship which is somewhere in the stratosphere leading him to crash

 june  murphy cooper is born

 the lazarus missions launch

 april  in the opening scene of interstellar cooper relives the crash in his sleep and murph wakes him up cooper goes to parentteacher conferences at which murph gets a suspension to her surprise a baseball  game is underway as a dust storm is rolling off the grand canyon and it reaches them murph sees something strange as the sand is in perfect columns this leads to the coordinates to nasa at night they arrive at nasa where cooper gets tazed at the gates tars approaches the truck cooper drives to get there much to murphys horror

 april  when cooper comes to he is confused and only one person is on coopers mind let me demonstrate

cooper wakes up

tars how did you find this place

cooper wheres my daughter

tars you had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map where did you get those coordinates

cooper wheres my daughter

amelia brand appears introducing herself assuring him that murph is okay cooper says albeit in a flirtatious way that he knows a dr brand except he was a professor and not nearly as cute cooper is explained about the mission and is told that they are the same nasa he flew for professor brand explains him all the details of the mission eventually convincing him to go along with them at night back at his house cooper and donald drink beer and talk over whats about to happen

 april  cooper tries to calm down an inconsolable murph in any way possible it doesnt work cooper reassures her that he is coming back says goodbye to tom tells donald to look after his children and before you know it they are in space eventually they escape earths orbit they go into hypersleep

 december  around  months after their departure from earth they use mars as a gravitational slingshot

 february   months after their slingshot around mars the crew wakes up from hypersleep and they enter the wormhole once they arrive at millers planet they realize that the time dilation factor is  in other words every hour on millers planet is  years on earth once they land they realize miller has no land and they realize millers lander is nothing but wreckage at this point they go towards the mountains only to find out that they are not mountains they are waves the wave that brand walks towards is moving away from them and that can mean one thing and one thing only given the waves distance away from them another wave is practically on top of them cooper warns them of an upcoming wave and the wave kills doyle itll take almost an hour for the engines to drain when it does however they just barely miss a third wave

 june  they arrive back on the endurance to a greyed romilly cooper has messages stored for him all of which are from tom  all but one and this one is live its murph although she is an adult now she explains that today is her birthday one that makes her just as old as him amelia is seen watching a message from professor brand after this message is done the crew talk about there next option

cooper tars kept the endurance right where we needed her but the trip took years longer than we anticipated we no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects so we have to choose

after some quarreling about how brand was using subjectivity to choose their next target they choose dr manns planet on their way in the embryo lab brand tells cooper that he will have to choose between a journey to edmunds planet or a return journey to earth next time around

late  the scene switches to murph now working at nasa running to an elderly professor brand on his deathbed he tells her the following

prof brand i let you all down

murph no you got us so far real close

prof brand  i wanted you to believe that your father would come back

murph i do professor

prof brand forgive me murph

murph theres nothing to forgive

prof brand i lied murph i lied to you there was no need for him to come back there was no way to help us

murph but all this all these people and the equation did my father know did he leave me

prof brand do not go gentle

and with that professor brand died shocked murph exited the room and sent a message to the crew on the endurance but case is the only one who got it for now as the rest of the crew left for the surface of dr manns planet which they were now in orbit around

upon arriving on dr manns planet they woke up dr mann who broke down in tears because he was so happy he saw another human being the crew told dr mann about the mission so far and dr mann told them that at the surface the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air even to life dr mann offers him an expedition to the probe landing sites and they set off

after arriving at the surface dr mann flicks off coopers transmitter and shoves him down to the ground cooper says what are you doing

mann im sorry i cant let you leave with that ship were gonna need it to complete the mission once the others realize what this place isnt we cannot survive here im sorry im sorry

with that cooper almost gets stabbed in the arm by what looks like metal spikes on dr manns boots cooper grapples onto something with something  and releases something probably air which somehow makes both of them tumble towards the surface at this time dr mann tells cooper everything including the fact that the planet has no surface

and then they wrestle on the top of frozen clouds on a planet with no surface during the brawl one of them releases a great deal of air out of the other persons tank via his arm and cooper says stop it dr mann pounds on coopers helmet several times and cooper pleads for him to stop as he pleads this dr mann pounds on his helmet more after cooper tells him what is at stake dr mann gives one final blow to coopers helmet which happens to bust it open as cooper is writhing and choking mann says dont judge me cooper you were never tested like i  was few men have been

heres what happened back on earth during all of this dr getty does a checkup on coop which tom walks in on and they dr getty tells him that earth is no longer habitable and that they along with everyone left on earth should probably leave this angers tom who punches doctor getty after some quarreling murph tells tom that he is risking the death of his own child this infuriates tom who demands her to get out and dont come back as murph leaves she tells coop to leave her stuff she drives off into a road with what looks like people who also know what is happening she torches some of toms crops tom notices the blazing of his crops on the horizon and he gathers his farmworkers to try and put it out

meanwhile on dr manns planet dr mann is watching cooper die but leaves because he doesnt have it in him to do so as cooper sits up he is still choking on ammonia and hes looking around for his mic piece dr mann assumes that cooper sees his children he recites the dylan thomas poem that prof brand recited when cooper left earth as this happens cooper spots his mic piece still intact dr mann takes his mic piece out when cooper puts his in when cooper does this dr brand hears a cry for help from cooper she tells case to wait up and when dr brand is on board case tells her that he has a signal from coopers transmitter and they use that to spot cooper but before they can cooper sees his children which can mean one thing and one thing only cooper is dying but dr brand sees him and cooper sticks his arm up she rushes towards cooper with an inhaler and as they both are on the lander cooper tells her that dr mann was lying

meanwhile in the compound romilly at tarss request unlocks kipp with his fingerprint as he does that he gets an incoming message

brand romilly do you read me romilly

tars step back professor step ba

and it all goes to hell dr mann sees his compound explode from afar leading him to steal the ranger as the lander makes it to whats left of the compound tars runs out and when he gets into the ranger he informs the crew of romillys death as dr mann is pushing into orbit he docks to the endurance imperfectly with disregard to the crews pleas he tries to override hatch lockout which he succeeds manually

after brand broadcasts a warning to dr mann he disregards it and unlocks the door causing the airlock to depressurize leading to a chain reaction that kills dr mann instantly and explodes a good chunk of the endurance causing it to spin uncontrollably and plummet to the surface cooper makes a lastditch attempt to dock to the spacecraft by matching the landers spin to that of the endurance something that case deems impossible but cooper deems necessary after successfully doing so they just so happen to slip directly into the pull of gargantua

at this point they find a plan to detach tars to lessen the weight of the endurance and to use as much fuel as they can according to cooper this amount of fuel will be too much to use enough to get to edmunds planet later so he uses a gravitational assist to slingshot them to edmunds planet

 according to coopers calculations the slingshot took  years on earth even though it took merely  minutes and  seconds to them which means that the time dilation factor was  million at this time tars detaches and so does cooper dr brand pleads coper not to do this saying you told me there were enough resources for the both of us cooper tells her we agreed amelia ninety percent detach indicating that he was lying after this brand leaves gargantua to go to edmunds planet once she arrives she finds that edmund is dead so she starts building a colony

beyond time after falling into the black hole cooper falls into a tesseract in the singularity of gargantua he doesnt know what it is yet but he sees murph and writes the stay message after hearing tars on the radio he explains to him where they are which then leads him to transmit the coordinates of nasa into binary and the data needed to complete the equation of quantum gravity over the second hand of the watch while using morse the tesseract closes which means that it worked humanity is saved he reaches out to touch amelias hand

 upon exiting the wormhole cooper is knocked unconscious and flashing lights appear in the distance the rangers pick him up with only minutes left in his oxygen supply he awoke in a hospital bed in a space station orbiting saturn called coopers station named after murph after cooper is released from the hospital he sees his daughter a yearold murph for the final time he was told to go find brand who she thinks is going into hypersleep cooper steals a ranger and sets off into the unknown",-0.9985,-1,-1

 a search feature if there is one already i havent found it i have several events for pleione  in my event log and i still have no damn clue where that even is

  the thing that the goods type filter view controls on the bottom right does but organized in a spreadsheet table

this window should show all planets one planet for each row then we would able to filter for a cargo type 

the columns would then show for each planet row

 amount of the cargo type available

 amount of the cargo type producedconsumed weekly

 amount of the cargo type  deliveredpicked up weekly average over a selectable time frame

 amount of the cargo type  combined producedconsumed and deliveredpicked up if the planet produced  excess cargo type and we trade  away this column would read 

 this is the column where we decide which ships to send to a different route

 if this number is very negative we know we need to haul more of the selected cargo type to the planetoid on this row

 if this number is very positive we can look in the third column if we are delivering cargo unnecessarily or use this planet as a source for the selected cargo type

while very spreadhsheety this view would be much better than having to go to each of the green planets  to determine which one needs water the most urgently

a luxury bonus would be an additional column where the time until the amount available on the planetoid reaches  is predicted",0.9388,1,1

a few useful strategies to make things easier for you

 use ships with a cloaking deviceelectronics bay for npc trade and passenger runs to avoid losing them to bounty hunters and hostilesso far not a viable tactic with npc mining

 use ships with lower cargo capacities to have npcs avoid station gridlock easiernpcs want to sell their full load at one time problematic if a station wont buy that much

 use a cloaking ship for attack missionsget behind the target while cloaked decloak fire full volley recloak recharge repeat

 use fleet ordersbutton at bottom right of orders to set aggression on npc ships to minimumto the left so they trade a larger variety of itemsto avoid gridlock also use fleet orders to set auto use for cloaking or to flee to station automatically

btw the flyer is good for cloaked trading the pioneer is good for cloaked passenger hauling
editthe flyer is good due to max upgrade speed and lowmoderate cargo the hornet is also good at up to  speed and  cargo but neither can have passengers

how to search a single planet for all the ls locations it can have  


how to search a whole planet for the plethora of living shipls locations each planet can havels locations are not limited like a solar systems max of  nonls ships a different ls will be at each different location you find

presearch preparations

 one void egg per ls
  nanites per ls
 must have completed the starbirth mission
 make room for a new ship acquisition or be prepared to exchange a ship you already have
 pick a planet you wish to searcha planet
 plot a course from a planet to the next closest planet or moonb planet and place your capitol ship a few seconds beyond the halfway point between the two bodies
 place the anomaly beyond your capital ship another   pulsing seconds or so by plotting a course from your capital ship near next to planet b and away from other bodies in the system
 always make sure a planet is further away than b planet at each location

search begins

once you have completed the placements above land on the a planet hop out of your ship making a save point place only one void egg into your exosuit inventory keep all additional void eggs in your capital ship

get into your ship and take off from a planet pulse directly to your capitol ship if the ls event occurs before you get close enough to your capitol ship to begin the event just reload your autosave and you are back to search begins

remember that you have  seconds of pulsing time where you can drag the event ls close enough to your capital ship before dropping out of pulse which starts the ls event

if you cannot activate the event before you reach your capitol ship pulse to the anomaly keep pulsing between your capitol ship and anomaly until you activate the event

once you have the new location land near the new ls accept or reject the ls if you reject the ls you are back to search begins

  
ps these living ship locations are all crash sites and also have a normal spaceship turn off the starbirth mission and reload your restore point to view the normal type ship appearence

what seems to be happening is they just remain in a cloaked state and let the enemy pound away on the magnus shielding with impunity as if they were zero aggressive and were set to not attack anything at all  my thought is the cloaks are keeping them from doing more than silently ghost along

"interstellar rift beta faq

 interstellar rift beta faq

interstellar rift beta faq nov httpspreviewredditfagjqlbkzpngwidthformatpngautowebpsdfcbbbcafacce

this faq has been approved by hurles and contains updated information

q what is interstellar rift

a interstellar rift is a space simulation game where you can gather resources construct your own ship from the inside out help build space stations with a crew of friends or play solo to further your goals in a procedurally generated galaxy

here is the beta trailer httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgnewbxzaashttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgnewbxzaas

q on what platforms will interstellar rift be available

a interstellar rift is currently available on steam for windows pc

q when will interstellar rift be released

a interstellar rift went into steam early access then entered beta on october   and is slated for a full release sometime later

q will i be able to play in single player

a yes however the game is focusing on multiplayer the single player game content is the same as multiplayer but your game will not appear in the server list so it will not have other players joining you can build stations and do missions for various factions to build reputation all while defending from occasional alien incursions we have plans for narrative driven missions however we will reveal more about those once we are closer to implementing them

q is interstellar rift an mmo

a interstellar rift is not an mmo but there is persistence for as long as a server is active and the save not reset players are currently playing on servers which have been persistent for two years servers will be privately hosted by players and we aim to support up to  players at a time at launch this number may increase later down the line

q what are the system requirements

a minimum and recommended specs are as follows

minimum

 os windows  or higher
 processor intel dual core ghz
 memory  gb ram
 graphics nvidia geforce gt  or higher
 network broadband internet connection
 hard drive  gb available space
 additional notes opengl  or higher required

recommended

 os windows  or higher
 processor amd or intel quad core
 memory  gb ram
 graphics nvidia geforce gtx  or higher
 network broadband internet connection
 hard drive  gb available space
 additional notes opengl  or higher required

you maybe be able to play the game on a system that does not meet the minimum requirements however we cannot guarantee that

q can i walk around inside my own ship

a yes you and your crew can get up and walk around the interior of your own custom starship while underway at any speed

q what can i do inside my starship

a ship interior gameplay is an integral part of interstellar rift you can take control of different ship systems gather different types of resources repair broken systems use gun turrets operate missile launchers build and dispatch drones defend your ship from aliens and hostile boarders trade with other players who you can teleport aboard or just socialize with your crew

q how many ships can i have can i change them

a you can have as many ships as you wish to build you can modify your current ship anytime as long as you have the materials and you can get everyone off the ship onto a station with a modification terminal so the upgrade work can be done to the ship

q can i attack other players and board their ship

a yes once you have disabled and hacked another player‚Äôs ship you can teleport aboard and raid it you can even steal their ship if you manage to disable their ability to respawn but the same can happen to you

q is this game a first person shooter

a the entire game is in first person boarding another player‚Äôs ship without permission can result in hostility which you can indeed resolve with the use of fps gameplay mechanics aliens may penetrate and infect ship systems which you will have to locate and destroy but the game is not focused around first person shooter gameplay shooting another player is a choice not a requirement

q how will i gather resources

a ships can be equipped with sensors resource extractors gas cloud harvesters and refinery equipment these can gather resources mine asteroids and produce construction materials there is a massive strip mining system for producing very large quantities of building materials and ram scoops for gathering or mixing gases for rare materials as well you can also build large drone bays and drones to dispatch and gather resources or defend you defeating aliens provides an opportunity to use a salvaging system to recover unique materials and some common types as well you can also raid cargo from other players space stations or trade for different resources

q will i be able to build space stations

a yes if you have gathered enough materials to construct a station you can build it on site or with a cockpit and engines to fly to your launch location you can provide power from solar panels and fix the position with a gravity anchor the process is nearly identical to ship construction you can use the ship editor terminal to customize it similar to how you construct a ship you can add weapons to it and there is even an invulnerable station shield but you will need special crystals to fuel it

q what stops me from creating a kilometer long ship completely covered in guns that will own everything that gets near it

a practicality every ship in interstellar rift requires power and oxygen and cpu to operate the shields and weapons the bigger your ship the higher the requirements projectile weapons missiles and lasers require ammunition and energy shields drain considerable power from the system opening a rift to travel to another star in such a ship would be incredibly expensive in resources nothing prevents you from creating a giant ship like that but whether or not you can maintain and defend it is the question

q my ship was destroyedstolen what now

a if your ship has an escape pod you can fly away and salvage the pod for some materials to start you can purchase or build another ship if you have the resources in your vault you can build another ship from your stored blueprints at the ship editor terminal each of the starter stations also has the equipment to allow you to quickly gather resources you can save the resources to build a ship yourself or sell them to purchase another ship already constructed at the storeotron many faction stations also have a terminal which will allow you to take out a loan to get you flying sooner

q i have built this gorgeous ship can i use it on other servers

a yes and no you cannot use a ship on any other server but the one you built it on however the blueprint for that ship is stored locally and will be available for you on every server you join all you need to do is gather the materials again to build it you can also share the blueprint files with others

q how will space travel work

a there are  modes of space travel in interstellar rift

 sublight travel this is your normal cruising speed in      this travel mode you will fight mine and basically do everything in this      mode you will have direct control over you ship and where it flies
 warp travel warp is your main mode of transport within      a star system it propels you faster than light and allows you to quickly      travel around a star system in this mode you will have minimal control      over your ship
 hyperspace jump the hyperspace jump allows you to      travel between different star systems instantly through a rift created by      a rift generator this is a point to point means of travel where the ship      is slowly flown through the created rift to a different star system you      can still walk around inside the ship while the jump through a rift is      occurring

q can i make videos using your games and monetize them

a yes we encourage people to make video‚Äôs using split polygon game content however the video must be free to access by everyone you cannot charge people to watch a video containing split polygon copyrighted materials we also do not allow you to license these videos out to other parties for payment of any kind you are free to monetize your video using the youtube partner program or similar services this policy only applies to interstellar rift and split polygon related materials any other content you choose to include in your video will require permission from the owner if you want this by email confirmation please dont hesitate to ask

"creative server pvp event by the person who brought you event horizon

on saturday june th at  est  utc ill be hosting a pvp event on the event horizon interim server thanks to crazydeviant for hosting if youd like to participate please join the eh discord httpsdiscordggxbhcvwhttpsdiscordggxbhcvw and see announcements if you have other questions about the event you can also ask them there  
you do not have to be an existing event horizon player to participate this event will be taking place on a creative server and you will be allowed to spawn in your ship designs and whatever ammo and resource you need to power it before the event starts the server will have creative mode turned off as soon as the event begins make sure your ship and whatever resources you need have already been spawned by then youll likely find giveallres an useful command for this the server is online right now and will stay so through the event so you should have plenty of time to prepare  
if you dont have any pvp ship designs or dont think youd make a good pilot you can still easily participate as a boarding party member  
i will also be running logging tools during the event to help the developers optimize combat on isr servers the more players who participate the more data splitpolygon can glean from the event   
event details  
participants will be divided among three teams each with their own nearly invulnerable but hackable and boardable station a neutral central station will be producing the spice at regular intervals youll need to hack the station gather as much spice as you can carry and bring it back to your teams station alternatively you can attack the other teams ships and stations and try to steal the spice from them the choice is yours  
there will be three  minute rounds to determine the winning team  
all participants will receive rtadvancedammo as a prize amount dependent on your teams finishing position on the main event horizon server   
a few ground rules on allowed ships and equipment  no unobtanium in your ship designs hopefully that didnt need clarified  no ships over k mass unloaded and  no repair firewall cartridges repair hacked systems and hack firewall cartridges are permitted  


see you then  


due to the current setup of hacking cartridges having repair firewall cartridges makes you essentially immune to hack attempts on a creative server where you could simply spawn more as needed allowing them means hacking simply wont be an option for attackers which obviously screws up my event rules a fair amount",0.8807,1,1

this blend not only fuels my body but also sharpens my mental clarity allowing me to maintain productivity and focus throughout my fast i found myself thinking clearer feeling more present and even having an enhanced sense of wellbeing all without the usual brain fog that accompanies prolonged fasting

so last month in february when interstellar was rereleased in india i always had it in my bucket list to watch it with my boyfriend because it was very special for both of us but due to my outstation work i had to go to bhopal and he had to go banglore so we decided together that we both wont watch it and will wait for rerelase even though i waited so many years n there was an opportunity to go with my colleagues to watch it 

now currently i am back to mumbai and he is still at bangalore and when i heard again that interstellar is rereleasing i didnt even think for a second to watch it here because we promised each other and he wasnt here
 
but today my bf told me he is going out for a movie with his best friend as he was visiting banglore and i had asked him which movie he was going to watch and he avoided saying they were getting late and i did ask him again and he avoided it then i questioned him over chat suspiciously and he sent me a picture saying that i will get angry and damn he was watching interstellar

and he called me when the intervel was going on and then i saw the pic he sent me and he started saying sorry and saying that his best friend booked those tickets but ofc he had an option to say no or cancel it but ofc he didnt

sooo after ignoring his  misscalls i have decided to watch it alone and not wait for a single day because i am going to do what i waited for years so tomorrow i am watching it as a solo date but confused about the dx or imax d

 he rigs kip to blow up in case someone tries to access the archives and in process kills romilly felt like such an abrupt cheap death for him just after he met his gang  years later  how does blowing up kip make sense it could easily turn out that the archival access happens when dr mann is nearby 

  
 this is kind of a lame question but ill ask it anyway  how does the pioneer of the mission open the air hatch when its not even docked i get that hes hurried and anxious and scared but he has an intricate understanding of space he is an astronaut after all

first i just want to say i really like this game its a lot of fun and im very excited for the multiplayer until then im trying my best to understand the game a few questions

 ive seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets my boxes are gray and i cant change them is this a new update

 its hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport foodconsumer goodsrare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage sometimes it transports food and i make  on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet im transporting to i know i can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless i say otherwise

 im having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet for example if machines are at  unitsunit time week and my ship holds  units i want to wait for a full load i set this in the criteria and i see whenever the planet produces some it goes to  i assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but i then saw another company ship export  and my ship still showed  this was very frustrating do we not split the produced resources or is it a fifo setting for ships set with full load setting

 the supplydemand charts dont explain to me how much  i will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless im missing something wish this was more clear

 it would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship overall profit is nice but id like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall

bombers strong turret but limited firing angle not as manoeuvrable as fighters

residential stations kinda budget trade station for non planet sectors buys food and water and generates credits
heavy weapons platform no elaboration needed
defensive strongholds station with large hangar repair good defence and a ship shop with frigates

"the interstellar paradox cooper and tars were ‚Äúthey‚Äù all along

in interstellar they are initially thought to be advanced beings guiding humanity however cooper‚Äôs realization‚Äîthey didnt bring us here we brought ourselves‚Äîsuggests something far more mindbending cooper and tars are ‚Äúthey‚Äù

the theory mine

 timeline   the origin

cooper and tars enter the black hole
due to extreme time dilation they remain trapped for millennia over time they evolve or discover how to manipulate higher dimensions they create the tesseract allowing their past selves to escape



 timeline   the intervention

cooper and tars place the tesseract inside gargantua they interact with their past selves cooper and tars guiding them out this sacrifices timeline  ensuring the loop continues



 a selfsustaining time loop

every version of cooper and tars relies on a previous iteration to survive there were never any ‚Äúhigher beings‚Äù helping‚Äîjust future versions of themselves ensuring the cycle perpetuates

why this makes sense
it resolves the bootstrap paradox the knowledge comes from a past cooper who spent eons inside the black hole

it aligns with the movie‚Äôs core theme time is a physical dimension that humans can manipulate

the quote supports it ‚Äúwe brought ourselves‚Äù suggests no divine intervention‚Äîjust humanity guiding itself

in essence cooper and tars aren‚Äôt just surviving the loop‚Äîthey are the loop",0.6458,1,1

"watched interstellar for the first time in theatres and it didnt hit me like i thought it would

please read the full post

i wanted to love this movie so much but after leaving the theatres i only felt it was okay at best part of it has to do with me already having been spoiled on some reveals by being on the internet whether it be through the memes or someone casually talked about it explaining something in an yt video post or reels etc but still i thought if its a wellmade movie i would enjoy it regardless but unfortunately that didnt happen

the parts i was spoiled on were cooper being the ghost and seeing murph grow up unable to do anything and something tragic happening the cooper crying scene in the memes and the this manoeuvre is going to cost us  years meme

maybe because of being spoiled the scenes in the movie didnt hit especially the emotional ones i really wanted to get invested in coop murph and the others story emotionally but just couldnt in any way

the soundtrack was great and the space scenes were really cool and looked really nice in the big screen

my favourite scene had to be the one where coop reattaches their ship to the spiralling station thats going down and then taking back control of it the tension there was so high off the roofs and the soundtrack there was chef‚Äôs kiss

a scene that i didnt feel good about was the monologue by dr brand about love i kept thinking at the back of my head that u are going to leave the fate of all humanity on love you are a scientist and u should make think and take logical decisions here but i feel like that was the point and nolan was trying to tell us about the power was love but that scene didnt really work imo

some more stuff i didnt enjoy were feeling like there were potholes like how cooper and taars created a fifth fucking dimension to rescue themselves and then closed it themselves it was too high scifi and not enough time to explain a lot of stuff felt like this movie would have been better if was longer and had more character interactions and scenes to cook up the emotional beats more and other exposition scenes and some bad decisions were made and there should have been consequences but i guess the movie is more about the emotional stuff so i will stop

main thing is that it didnt hit me and i feel thats an essentially part of this movie i know its a me problem and this isnt a hate post quite the contrary i can see why this movie is so loved and i made this post to just talk about the movie with people i dont really have that many friends to talk about it

the ending was a bit unsatisfactory for me i would have to say i thought i already knew the ending copper was going to be there trapped forever rewatching his last moments over and over and how he treated murph and contemplate on his decisions i was surprised when the movie kept going and they reunited with her being so old and then going to look for dr brand i kept thinking u are not going to interact with your blood family ie your grandchildren and their children and neither are going to interact with him too and the humans now have so powerful tech that they can rescue coop but not dr brand i felt like she should have been rescued first no and certainly coop will rescue her easypeasy because of the tech so what was the point was ending there shouldnt they have reunited and end with them together in a farm that should have been a better ending if u ask me but i digress

i usually post my thoughts and discuss it in subreddits whether its a media i watched or a game i played and this post was made with that intention so now the question what did u guys think about the movie and how did u perceived it when u first watched it

i want to know about peoples story who watched it for the first time blind and their experience how it became your fav movie and how much u would rate it if its not your fav personally would say its a  sorry i intend to do a rewatch in the future with better sound the theatre sound i felt was a bit low to my taste

have to say i was surprised to see who were in this movie except matthew mcconaughey jessica chastain those  i knew but timoth√©e chalamet matt damon john lithgow michael caine topher grace¬†and finally wes bentley i kept thinking where i have seen wes bentley and after i googled him i realized oh he was in the first hunger game and its yellowstone whose only  episode i have watched these casting were a real surprise wasnt expecting so many big names to show up

anyways thank you for reading and please dont downvote me i am sure some of u have the same experience with some other media that u got spoiled and didnt hit as much even though u were desperately wanting to like it i just want to talk about the movie and let‚Äôs do that in the comments i will also maybe keep editing the post to add more stuff that comes to my mind about the movie thats it

hope the mods dont delete it

¬†edit after  hours of browsing interstellar related stuff 

after reading several posts and a bunch of paragraphs of explanations  deep dives and themes  i will have to admit i missed a lot of the sciency stuff but the main reason why i feel like i didnt connect with this movie is because of love 

i did not feel the love between coop and murph i know it may seem obvious but its a major factor i think controversial you might say but i did not feel the love between the  actors i know its a me thing and others are definitely not going to agree but love is subjective and i guess i wasnt in the right mood to sob or feel the love my heart wasnt open this time 

i will for sure give it a rewatch in the future and really hope to get the  i get it now moment  this time",0.9992,1,1

hey guys

i have been playing in universe  a wormhole too far and i have amassed about  million credits my main base of operations is at beta pindola and i have established all the stations except for the refinery and the orbital farm now here comes the issue there is a severe lack of nanochips all the refineries in the universe have no nanochips in their cargo bay this would mean that any product that requires nanochips cannot be produced medipacks hoverbikes hypersleep pods and plasma rifles this causes all trade to grind to a halt so i was thinking it could be because there was a lack of copper ore however all mining ships including my own are filled with ore but cannot find a place to sell them this may be a possible glitch because i can manually sell the ore at any refinery but on autopilot the ships just cannot seem to be able to sell them i was hoping you guys have an answer to this thanks

in that sense it was chillingly convincing but it did result in people being confused as to what he said its thankful that murph repeats what he said right afterwards twice and i did understand it myself but i wonder if maybe the delivery of those lines could have sacrificed naturalism for the sake of audiences being able to keep up what do you think",0.9581,1,-1

"where is this game even going

i just got out of a match filled with team killing crossteam teamspeak shenanigans to control entire rounds and straight up neglect for anyone wanting to actually play the game

and this is saddening since theres only ever one multiplayer server decently filled up with players at a time and multiplayer is the only entertaining and i use that word lightly thing to do since sp and coop have had their replay value wringed dry from the sponge that is this game

im so sorry for being a negative nancy but i really dont see where this game is headed or rather i do see what its aiming for but the path being taken to get there is just so whuh a lot of minor features are being prioritised over what could be bigger more entertaining core features no not campaign i get that the game itself needs to be on a good foundation before a good campaign can even be conceived and not coop either because if any more coop is made with the way the game is now itll barely hold anyones attention for more than a run or two hell not even landsharks or mechs yet id hate for two of the games biggest shticks to be crammed in and sloppily done

but i played a match yesterday almost filled to capacity of the server with people who i figured werent too tightly knit with the community i figured itd be better to ask the average player what they thought the game really needed right now rather than the diehard believe fan wholl talk your ear off about the game needing to be more realistic

and summed up they said

 weapons for more variation sniper dmr shotgun etc  weapons along with numerous accessories gadgets and equipment or even freely customizable weapons simulation yeah can we start to see some of this bullseye even had interchangeable sights
 grenades or equipment in general
 loadouts customisable from the menu to allow selection of the above two primary secondary which would just be pistol for the time being and equipment that and player customisation in general one of the ambitious goals is to let the player be their own interstellar marine yes were still all painfully normal persistent character development and skill system
 dm on a map like starcrown oddly specific but the idea was dm muck around with no limitations on maps of the players choice
 laser pointers with only the dot not the strobe another specific but the lasersight does more harm than good would be great if we could still see the strobe for allies to see where theyre aiming because tactics

and then some other things ive heard in passing for more general things that might help i doubt it though stuff like leaning map design that doesnt feel like you can be shot from anywhere updating your website so the forum spam is fixed  the most recent thing isnt sitrep  performance improvements a melee to not kill but at least deter the people who spray  pray charge and helps spcoop because bots and just performance improvements all around

i know you guys are a small team im sorry to hear that im sorry that things are the way they are i get it one step at a time but try to take the right steps in the right order its a little depressing that people dont have much of a reason to stay and keep playing the game needs something to work towards progression the tr system is so wow apparently you guys are working on a progression system ive seen the prologue mockup and frankly it looks great put all your effort into that and everything that needs to surround that to make it work clearing missions challenges and so on for unlocks seems great but if the missionschallenges are painfully simple few  far between or even give lackluster rewards youve unlocked  tr points or youve unlocked an emblemachievement then itll be a flop im is already on life support as it is in terms of fame  playing population ive got no idea how the financial situation is but again goodluck

"the ending

i love this movie but let me be a little critical of the end and see if people disagree

why is there a giant museum of the ‚Äúfarming‚Äù days on the space station weren‚Äôt these things constructed in a rush to save humanity from starvation isn‚Äôt it established that it takes about  years to get to saturn do these people really need a museum to the doom they were living under just two years ago complete with a replica of the chief scientist‚Äôs childhood house aren‚Äôt they about to enter the wormhole in these massive untested space stations for the first time 

why does everyone treat cooper like a stupid asshole and not a hero of humanity the doctors are clowning on him for thinking the station might be named after him and his own family presumably grandchildren and great grandchildren treat him like a pariah and display a total lack of awe about the situation wouldn‚Äôt it have been a better and more realistic ending to have everyone treating him like a hero and wanting to ask questions but instead he still flys off to meet brand

all of these is overshadowed by the beauty of his reunion with murph and his determination to meet brand ‚Äúby the light of our new sun‚Äù but on a second watch that whole part feels off",0.9827,1,1

"can factions be destroyed

short answer sort of

long answer not completely in my war with the bandits i discovered that any station destroyed simply respawned when i wasnt looking sending me on a never ending cycle of blowing up outposts and the occasional laser turret

then i dropped three laser turrets on the site where they rebuild i did this every time i killed an outpost

they cant rebuild because as long as theyre tagged hostile my turrets will open fire before their construction reaches  theyve dropped to the bottom of the faction list and since outposts spawn fighters i think weve seen the last of them

next ill take on black sail well see how this works with a larger faction im concerned about blowing up trade stations though  theyre the only market for finished goods and players cant build their own

edit bandit ships will respawn from fortuna and black sail bases ive now dropped turrets next to them as well as an added bonus this will give me a nice sneak attack when i go to war with them",-0.9621,-1,-1

 if you have a decent trade fleet you will quickly find some stations backing up

 protect what you got you will be attacked a lot at first

do you need an edge when it comes to taking tests  creative tasks requiring great mental fortitude¬† then autonomous is what i have used personally to ace several civil engineering tests that all required much logical mathematical and mechanical reasoning¬† some of us find it very hard to turn potentiality into actuality and to manifest one‚Äôs will into the world¬† and for such a reason alone autonomous¬†will always be part of my daily personal stack¬†

moreover as a musician composer it has helped me to finish projects that ordinarily i would have found way too complex and boring even to attempt¬† using this one blend alone has enriched my ‚Äú inner life ‚Äú so to speak in more ways than one¬† giving me a newfound sense of creativity that can only come from a place of authentic selfexpression",0.9326,1,1

coopers promise of returning to murph inadvertently leads to doyles death

"the juxtaposition of dr mann and cooper

i recently got to watch interstellar in imax during its anniversary run and i was totally blown away by everything the movie has to offer i want to make this post to share a viewpoint of mine regarding the characters  the juxtaposition of dr mann and cooper

mann was repeatedly touted as the best the world has to offer he mentions that he has no attachment on earth no family and he chose to participate in operation lazarus in this case mann represents an archetype of the hero who believes in noble ideas and is willing to sacrifice himself for the betterment of mankind 

cooper on the other hand has family they are the reason he went on the trip not to save the world but to save his family he has attachments and people he cares about all the way he insisted on going back to earth to see his family thus coop is somewhat the opposite of mann he has attachments while mann does not he fights for the people he personally cares about while mann fights for the idea of mankind

however this juxtaposition played out quite differently than imagined the noble mankind representative mann betrayed his mission reporting in false data in order to be saved while the somewhat selfish cooper ultimately made the choice to sacrifice himself in order to save mankind 

this in my opinion shows how having something concrete reason to fight for your family loved ones is more powerful than fighting for some lofty ideas for mankind it is easy to talk big to gloat about noble ideas but in the end it is the personal attachments that make us the strongest like how a soldier isnt fighting for his country he is fighting for his family and loved ones 

it reminds me of a quote  patriotism does not start out as the love for ones country it starts as the love for ones family ones street ones neighborhood",0.9967,1,1

"supplying stations with resorces

hi guys 

i have a couple of questions regarding stations 

firstly how do my stations obtain supplies my guess is that other npc traders come to my stations and sell the required materials to my station for production

secondly i have noticed that there are insufficient npcs who come to my stations to supply them with goods to produce fewer than those who come to my station to buy the product eg not enough food grains to produce pindolan ale as such i want to build my own orbital farms etc to supply my own stations when the say for example grains are ready do they automatically transfer to the brewery for production or do i have to do it manually

thirdly if i have to transfer manually is it possible to transfer it using autopilot

"changes to the event horizon isr server

isr  is launching on september th in an attempt to capitalize on the increased player traffic that the launch will hopefully bring there are going to be considerable changes to how event horizon httpeventhorizonsitehttpeventhorizonsite httpsdiscordggsqfmpshttpsdiscordggsqfmps operates this includes a full wipe of the main eh server though players wont necessarily be starting over with zero resources more details on that below

the goals of these changes are to encourage longer term player retention encourage more regular player interactions both pve and pvp interactions and to give long term goalsachievements for players and organizations 

these changes will include but are not necessarily limited to

‚Ä¢fewer star systems in the eh galaxy currently looking at about  useful systems in total

‚Ä¢a new central star system hadron that all players will start in

‚Ä¢limited resource spawns in the asteroid belts both of type and quantity

‚Ä¢seasons of pvp and pve though there will be one permanent pve star system and one permanent pvp star system

‚Ä¢addition of randomly spawning short lived asteroid fields same as the ones that spawn at npc mining stations note that these fields will have more than just t resources these will spawn in random locations encouraging players to seek them out and compete with other groups to mine them

‚Ä¢return of server events such as pvp tournaments but also pve events

‚Ä¢a new unique currency eventium on the server represented by a custom resource players can earn this currency in various ways including trading withstealing from other players players will be able to trade eventium in for other resources but they will also be able to use it to purchase custom stations purchase special services or use it to purchase resources after the wipes automated scripts will be in place to help with many of these eventium transactions which will hopefully allow it to be considerably more useful 

not all of these changes will be present on event horizon as soon as  launches and are subject to change based on what  adds and how many players eh can attract with the  launch the current eh server will continue as is until the th and will probably still be left online at least temporarily after the  launch the new server will simply take its place on the th

potentially frequently asked questions

why are you wiping the server i dont want to start over again

the server wipe does two things the first and primary reason is that it allows me to create a new isr server and work on setting it up over the next few weeks without needing to worry about preservingtransferringlosing player progress the second reason is that its encouraging for new players to know that everyone else on the server dont have a massive advantage over them and for many existing players its more engaging to have a fresh start 

that said i know starting completely over in isr can be a bit of a grind so starter packs will be given out to existing players based on how long theyve been on the discord if you left the discord and then came back later on ill still count it the exact amount and type of resources in the starter packs has yet to be decided but it will be based on the tier system  years equals t  year equals t  months equals t and anyone arriving before the launch of  will get some t resources more details on that can be found on the eh discord httpsdiscordggsqfmpshttpsdiscordggsqfmps leading up to the  launch

why are you having so few star systems other servers have hundreds

the huge number of star systems that isr spawns by default is actually a problem with isr even if you assume a server regularly has  players something that has never happened star systems in isr are already so enormous that you could put the full  players in a single star system remove signatures and transponders and it would be practically impossible to find another player even in vectron syx on popular servers the only time youll run into another player is when theyre back at hsc ic to rearmstore their ship the rest of the time players are scattered across the stars on a server with even  star systems pvp is practically impossible and even just trying to meet up with other players to trade withcrew with them is a chore   
having infinite star systems also equals infinite resources which completely removes any reason to interact with other players for resources why trade withfight with other players for resources when you can just as easily or even easier mine them yourself by finding a system with a high rating of your target resource

what special services  
good question i havent thought of very many at the moment it would be things like allowing players to rename planetsstars and to have the skrillfaction rating of a system adjusted im sure players will give me other ideas as we go forwards  
pvppve seasons  
this is an idea i acquired from other empyrion servers during that brief period where i hosted an emp server for eh apologies to those players who wanted such a server for longer it proved to be more effort than i was willing to give especially as empyrion was a game i didnt find very engaging  
the star systems on event horizon will cycle between majority pve and majority pvp toggle on a regular cycle if youre not interested in engaging in pvp you can still play on event horizon but pvp players will get bonus eventium and other rewards for beating other groups there will also be changes to encourage raids of other orgs stations during pvp seasons

  
after the wipes what wipes

this is the one change im not fully decided on im considering having the server wipe every so often with a handful of things carrying over like eventium im not fully convinced that the benefits of this outweigh the downsides but at minimum these wipes would only take place every  months at the minimum most likely even rarer

"gavin changed my life  blend mega combo 

what‚Äôs up everybody i just had to share my immense gratitude and the lifechanging experience i‚Äôve had with gavin‚Äôs creation interstellar blends

my name is francis i‚Äôm  and i‚Äôm from quebec canada to give you some context i‚Äôm workin four jobs  are extremely physical and the th is trading which demand alot of mental power and focus in the summer i work  to  hours a day sometimes even more it‚Äôs absolutely draining

by the end of  my body and mind hit a breaking point the nonstop grind caught up i hit a wall make of fuc‚Ä¶ titanium‚Ä¶ my whole system was shutdown it got me crazy health issues i was dealing out of nowhere with fungal infections constant headaches autoimmune flareups mcas and a completely wrecked nervous system my nervous system was so shut i was shaking when standing up my whole mind was in the dark depressive spiral and i started having thoughts i‚Äôd never wish on anyone it was hell‚Ä¶

that‚Äôs when by the grace of god gavin announced a challenge to win a  blend mega combo and guess what my friend and i won this was a blessing because i had no idea how to recover from this hole i was in

when the package arrived it was game on i immediately started fasting with the blends and water for six days to start my recovery asap normally fasting for me is kinda hard and by day  im half dead in my bed wondering why the f i started a fast lol  i‚Äôd be drained barely functioning but with the blends is another dimension literally it didnt felt like a was fasting at all

by the rd day i was sleeping like a rock which i wasnt able to do for at least y and waking up feeling like a whole new person i couldn‚Äôt believe how effortless fasting felt for anyone who struggles with fasting seriously reach out to gavin just follow the steps gavin gives you and you‚Äôll be golden fast

after the  day fast i broke the fast with some worries because i have bad experience of refeeding in the past ive put the worries aside and broke the fast the best i could and‚Ä¶ not a single issues no histamine flares up no pain nothing this blew my mind because i‚Äôve had severe digestive problems since i was yo like mcas sibo sifo and mold toxicity in the past fasting always came with nasty crazy symptoms especially during refeeding but with the blends i bounced back like i never though possible tons of energy laser focus for trading and vitality was through the roof

i‚Äôve done alot lab testing the past years to track pathogens deficiencies and other health issues after just one month on the blends i did the same lab test and  of the issues pathogen and defiencies were completely rgone  in one freaking month it still doesnt make sense to me loll good luck finding a doctor that will do that for you‚Ä¶

on top of that my hair is growing back after starting to bald at  super tonic hair for the win talking about wins lol if you ever had ed type of issues‚Ä¶ thunder is quite insane and effective‚Ä¶ i will no into details but it was life changing for multiple person ahah

if you have digestive issues you have to take the stomach reset combo the first  day with the purge can be a mess it was for me but after the big clean up it feels like you are flying heaviness is lifted from your soul

i cant thank gavin enough for this incredible opportunity the timing was divine and it saved my life i wasnt sure how i‚Äôd pull myself out of this mess i was in  but with god‚Äôs grace i took the chance and it was worth it 

now still thriving i gave some of the blends to close familly member espacially victorious when they got cov victo with peels and spice got cov down in  days  this is revolutionary lol

"my favorites wowza

let me review my very favorite blends i have tried quite a few

first i started using interstellar blends over  years ago i started with the peel blend which helps with keeping blood sugars down i used a blood glucose monitor to track my morning blood fasting levels each day to see if the blend really affected my glucose sure enough a few weeks later my readings were consistently in the  range upon waking rather than  so i kept taking the peel blend i kind of began to crave it a few months later i noticed that in addition to my reduced glucose levels i was also not getting the colds and flu even when everyone else in the house got sick wow peel has remained a daily blend for me ever since

my second blend that was lifechanging was trinity this blend helps with anxiety i am truly one of those adaptable i can handle anything kind of people until i wasnt with perimenopause came some real deep anxiety and strong emotions that were rough i was crying my hisband asking what was wrong i would tearfully say i dont know i started on trinity and a week later no more tightness in the chest no more tears i went along like this for a few months and ran out of my trinity i had no clue how much it was helping until i didnt have it the crash of anxiety and sadness came back in a swoop until i could get more ordered and taken for a couple days but that is the cool thing about trinity it doesnt dull emotions or make you feel flat like some medications it just makes you feel like a regular person again i will never again let myself run out of this blend

right now i am experimenting with a few of the newer blends that help with metabolism and weight loss nrf trigliceride fatty liver and ceramide are some of the blends in the mix ive struggled with weight gain with perimenopause and decided to tackle the issue in  months i have lost  pounds and still losing the online community for interstellar blends is incredibly supportive and i am motivated to continue my weight loss journey supported by the blends

its always the same thing doesnt matter whether your still in college or at top level private company something always goes missing honestly how does doctor barbero expect me to continue work when the supplies keep going missing

doctor sarah was right someone is accessing the storage room taking supplies without signing them off whoever it is only old time stamps left i cant identify anything else ill ask hank choo to check on this and see if anyone altered the access mechanism but im still waiting for his report i should notify mr snyder about this

audio log  hank choo 

leo stark asked me to check on the access door to the storage room apparently someone has been accessing it without leaving any record of whos access card was used the access mechanism is working fine and the manual override hasnt been used as far as i can tell given the circumstances i think someone got their hands on a skeleton key but the only people able to produce one would be me david calru and snyder still not sure if i should report this back to mr lee or mr snyder

audio log  william barbero 

snyder just came around asking about the missing supplies from storage had to tell him about dr magellans latest break through and about the replication of the results he became rather interested in my own side experiments asking me to continue and not to worry about docs investigation apparently hes contacting the ito defense department are interested in this kind of research which means funding is no longer an issue even if neurogen pulls the plug on us

audio log  leo stark 

just finished reading hanks and choos report he cant find anything wrong with the access mechanism to the storage area so i got no other option but to keep a close eye on this to make matters worse when i mentioned this event to snyder he said if i couldnt find anything else i should just let it die i cant do thatm i have an obligation to these people there safety is my responsibility if theres any foul play and it endangers the crew ill be crucified

talking to mr snyder about the storage situation seemed to expedite our next delivery neurogen headquarters is sending a coald mission  days ahead of schedule ill have to send a team to clear the hangar bay for the extra supply were getting but at least kimmie will have a birthday gift in time this year instead of having to wait for the usual delivery date despite all the hassle theres a silver lining i really hope she likes it i miss my little girl

audio log  william barbero 

dr magellans latest results are quite promising however she did forget to mention some rather interesting side effects on a small percentage of the test sample some of the subjects exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to pain increased aggressiveness and intermittent explosive disorder as reported previously by dr magellan on a special note the sample in the sample takes that aggression to rather extreme perpicks i cobbled off the subjects forged channer to the point of inflicting lethal injuries on one another without stopping or diminishing the ferocity of the attacks

dr barbero has been moody as of late since my last breakthrough hes been so focused on his lab he barely takes a rest im concern hell soon enough have a nervous breakdown i dont get it why hes acting like this i mean i know the investor meeting is in a couple of days and the progress weve had is tremendous im sure neurogen will continue to fund us there is no need for this

audio log  william barbero 

ive been replication dr magellans experiment and finally identified and isolated neurogenic prenos for the decreased sensitivity to pain aggressiveness and reminiscences to shoot one way to control this was to include an energy plutonic agent that increases sensibility to suggestion the aggression is still there but the subjects can be more easily controlled by a third party also aerial dispersion of modified viral agent has proven to be just as effective as in its original formation and much simpler to apply just need to place samples on a closed environment and its ready

"where is this game even going

i just got out of a match filled with team killing crossteam teamspeak shenanigans to control entire rounds and straight up neglect for anyone wanting to actually play the game

and this is saddening since theres only ever one multiplayer server decently filled up with players at a time and multiplayer is the only entertaining and i use that word lightly thing to do since sp and coop have had their replay value wringed dry from the sponge that is this game

im so sorry for being a negative nancy but i really dont see where this game is headed or rather i do see what its aiming for but the path being taken to get there is just so whuh a lot of minor features are being prioritised over what could be bigger more entertaining core features no not campaign i get that the game itself needs to be on a good foundation before a good campaign can even be conceived and not coop either because if any more coop is made with the way the game is now itll barely hold anyones attention for more than a run or two hell not even landsharks or mechs yet id hate for two of the games biggest shticks to be crammed in and sloppily done

but i played a match yesterday almost filled to capacity of the server with people who i figured werent too tightly knit with the community i figured itd be better to ask the average player what they thought the game really needed right now rather than the diehard believe fan wholl talk your ear off about the game needing to be more realistic

and summed up they said

 weapons for more variation sniper dmr shotgun etc  weapons along with numerous accessories gadgets and equipment or even freely customizable weapons simulation yeah can we start to see some of this bullseye even had interchangeable sights
 grenades or equipment in general
 loadouts customisable from the menu to allow selection of the above two primary secondary which would just be pistol for the time being and equipment that and player customisation in general one of the ambitious goals is to let the player be their own interstellar marine yes were still all painfully normal persistent character development and skill system
 dm on a map like starcrown oddly specific but the idea was dm muck around with no limitations on maps of the players choice
 laser pointers with only the dot not the strobe another specific but the lasersight does more harm than good would be great if we could still see the strobe for allies to see where theyre aiming because tactics

and then some other things ive heard in passing for more general things that might help i doubt it though stuff like leaning map design that doesnt feel like you can be shot from anywhere updating your website so the forum spam is fixed  the most recent thing isnt sitrep  performance improvements a melee to not kill but at least deter the people who spray  pray charge and helps spcoop because bots and just performance improvements all around

i know you guys are a small team im sorry to hear that im sorry that things are the way they are i get it one step at a time but try to take the right steps in the right order its a little depressing that people dont have much of a reason to stay and keep playing the game needs something to work towards progression the tr system is so wow apparently you guys are working on a progression system ive seen the prologue mockup and frankly it looks great put all your effort into that and everything that needs to surround that to make it work clearing missions challenges and so on for unlocks seems great but if the missionschallenges are painfully simple few  far between or even give lackluster rewards youve unlocked  tr points or youve unlocked an emblemachievement then itll be a flop im is already on life support as it is in terms of fame  playing population ive got no idea how the financial situation is but again goodluck

i‚Äôm a college student an astrophysics major i first saw interstellar ten years ago i was eleven and i didn‚Äôt have the media literacy or scientific knowledge to enjoy the film to its fullest extent of course i‚Äôm still learning even today i didn‚Äôt even finish it‚Äîi was halfasleep and went to my room for the night while the others finished the movie 

i watched it again recently so excited for it to be my ‚Äúreal‚Äù first time the thing is though things have changed in my life almost a year and a half ago i learned that i was donorconceived it was an egg donor my mom‚Äîthe woman who bore me and raised me‚Äîis not genetically related to me my genetic mother i don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbiological‚Äù here‚Äîbirth is biology is a stranger the process was anonymous anyway i‚Äôve been thinking of the film since i watched it and i‚Äôve seen parallels between humanity‚Äôs journey and my own story 

for me what happened with my mom‚Äôs eggs is like the blight that ravages earth humanity is forced to the stars because the alternative is extinction i am sure that if you asked the humans on cooper station especially the older ones who had memories of their home planet the majority would say they would‚Äôve rather stayed on earth if it hadn‚Äôt gotten so inhospitable there‚Äôd be some other timeline out there where the blight never happened maybe where humankind thrived on earth assuming they took better care of it similarly if it weren‚Äôt for the problem with my mom she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten an egg donor and i as i know myself today would never have existed there‚Äôs some other world out there with another child who really is the product of my mom and dad‚Äôs genetic material i was not that child though i spent most of my life thinking i was i only exist because of the problem with my mom‚Äôs fertility just as everyone born on cooper station edmund‚Äôs planet or anywhere else beyond the earth owes their being to the tragedy that befell their ancestral home 

what i also know is that interstellar is a story of human resiliency a story where humankind looks extinction in the face and says ‚Äúfuck you i‚Äôm still alive‚Äù and i‚Äôm here i‚Äôm alive the blight wanted to stop me from existing but i found a way i‚Äôm going to live

thanks for all the feedback you gave im currently working on more as i type this

 the expansion period

xb

early on all of the sol system used gatopea as an interstellar playground  there was no limits no laws and a wild abundance of incredibly rare materials back on earth  at this time in history this sector was originally an asteroid field but that was quickly overmined   some small expedition crews were sent to its flagship planet where raw materials could be easily collected

expansion to other sectors became easy  androla and hellemus became the goto hub for mining and raw resources  terekos was the breadbasket of the new frontier   they discovered a new planetary sector galene which served as a trading post for exotic goods  expansion to beta pindola was difficult as primitive bandit factions united to defend the area  tef captured them in a massive battle during the great pindolan war beta pindola was the secondary major hub of the frontier

two new ships were created  the shuttle and the raptor  the shuttle immediately outclassed the ranger as the primary spacecraft as it was both economical and can be used for almost everything  the raptor was similar to the shuttle and ranger but was build with scouting and light combat in mind

a number of factions were set up including lambda corp which originally specialized in crosssector freight   alghat was an exotic materials and weapons dealer that settled in galene  nobody really liked them but they were needed to keep tef stocked with their navy

the group of primitive bandits and runaway outlaws united under black sail but were still divided into their own territories   they generally avoided contact with anyone else and set up bases in the previously undiscovered dymapa 

after operation casbah by lambda solace was discovered but was almost immediately overrun by bandits  solace was used by the bandits to produce arms and equipment as well as the rallying point of the capitol ships",0.8854,1,1

but they again broke the truce and i had to destroy their whole fleet and a station because although i paid for the truce they still attacked and so did my ships and truce broke
after killing them all i again made truce but saw that it was some k credits but still paid it off and they were on red relation although i never attacked them they continued to break the truce and i cant pay k every single time and now i cant even do thier missions to increase relation i dont want to kill every single one of them i cant and i had earlier good trade routes going through thier sectors and war doesnt allow me to trade with farway sectors which i am dependent on for credits

"combat  or what would happen if isr was developed solely by me

basically writing this for fun but hopefully the devs take some ideas from this

goals

 every combat situation has multiple ways it can go down besides one of the ships blows up
 extended combat duration the max possible dps should take a minute minimum with constant firing to destroy the max possible ehp
 jack of all trades master of none for combat vessels
 piracy high risk high reward
 which weapons you have has more of an impact

im going to try to keep the following from being too much of a wall of text but a lot of this stuff is closely tied together so youll have to bear with me

xb

section  ship health

at this point i think everyone knows my views on armor gens and the flaws with them so well skip that revert ship health to simply hull some changes only walls floors and ceiling tiles provide the hull points alternatively add heavier exterior blocks that provide hull points in addition to standard lighter exterior blocks additionally cap max hull something relatively high 

xb

section  cpu

cpu is a good tool to ensure that gunwalls arent a thing but we dont have to tie every system related to combat into it by doing so youre reducing the likelihood of people using them in the first place since an extra gun is almost always going to be worth more limit hacking terminals to just one per ship same for the emp emp can have a greater emphasis on being skill based with a longer cooldown ammo loaders dont need to cost cpu at all you can load them with an actr and as far as i know the devs dont intend to change that even now i dont bother with more than a few ammo loaders if space is a concern since a cargo pad and an actr have a much better ammoship tile ratio

xb

section  ship speeds

the low end of the isr speed cap is  ms however thats  mph for comparison a formula  car goes less than  mph obviously space is much bigger and some people build ships big enough it takes time to fly from one end to the next still its a lot faster than it needs to be you can cross the  km weapon range in  seconds and the top speed disparity between  ms and  ms makes for certain aspects of combat balancing complicated  reduce max speed to  ms and turning is harder the faster your ship is moving scaling up with the mass of your ship turn speed gains a mass cap like we have now for ship speeds

xb

section  rock paper scissors

by significantly reducing ship speeds weapon range can have more of an impact since you cant simply close the gap in a few seconds due to technical limitations of isr max possible range of any weapon is km but that still leaves enough wiggle room for significant differences some other rps balance options in isr are things like rof accuracy countermeasures torpedoes could have significant range and damage compared to other weapons but are vulnerable to being shot down or disrupted by an emp burst spoolup railguns travel time of the projectiles extended cooldowns on super weapons and of course damage

xb

section  specialization

rps balancing is hampered by weapon groups since any benefits or negatives of choosing one weapon setup over another are nonexistent when you can have  possible weapon arrangements limit ships to one weapon group there is the option to adjust what weapons are active in a group in game already so you wouldnt have to return to port to change armaments but it shouldnt be fast enough to easily do so in combat

xb

section  shields

shields should remain tied to the cpu system but cpu cost could be reduced and shields should have more flexibility add a slider to shield gens one end marked regen rate one end marked max capacity slider should be synced across all shield gens if you expect to be dealing with high rof weapons increase regen rate someones coming after you with a railgun alphastrike ship crank up the capacity once your shields hit  it takes considerably longer for them to come back online devs are already planning that one  ion ammo and ammunition that deals different damage to shields than hull add unneeded complexity imo

xb

section  hacking

hacking is an interesting tool for combat balancing as everyone is equal assuming you limit everyone to one cyber terminal some improvements are needed however add a hacking screen in the cockpit so you dont need to dedicate a crew member to hacking to get any use out of it some skill aspect could also be added like a simple quick time eventhttpsyoutubeyqynyimct that you can operate with just a single key for the cards instead of them being used as ammo for hacking they could instead upgrade the terminal increasing range automatically preform the quicktime event when defending increase max firewall health reduce connection time or reducing recovery time youre limited to  slots with just one terminal so you could potentially get quite creative with rps balancing here as well

xb

section  scanning visibility and stealth

this is a mechanic that has always fascinated me because of the possibilities and i really hope devs come back to the scanner mechanic in particular some ideas there heat mechanic when fully implemented plays heavily into how youre detected at long ranges also could have active and passive scanners go active and you can more easily find and track other ships but you turn into a light on a hill

the cloak gen was frankly a massive letdown for me when it was released as all the restrictions on it render it little more than a poor alternative to the station shield

in my perfect world cloak gen no longer has any affect at longer ranges but it engages the deep cloak clear shader instantly however the cloak gen can only maintain a cloak for a limited amount of time possibly dependent on the mass of the ship firing weapons no longer break cloak but you could track the ship by looking at the weapon projectiles looking for heat signatures or large amounts of active scanning successfully hitting a cloaked ship would break its cloak early

xb

section  device damage

like hacking interior damage lends itself to being a balancing tool but right now it has almost no impact on combat for a few reasons combat doesnt last long enough for the power loss from damaged devices to make an impact many devices dont actually lose any functionality when damaged and theres also the problem of how device damage is decided in the first place right now interior devices take damage based on how close they are to the point of impact on the exterior i believe its a  meter sphere around the point of impact that determines what devices are damaged this system does however mean you can prevent device damage entirely by surrounding your ship with exterior blocks more than m away from the actual interior of your ship

im not sure what technical limitations are in place but im going to presume that any system that can track the angle that a projectile hit at and create a straight line along which devices are damaged isnt possible if it is possible then please implement that if its not possible however decide what devices are damaged are picked through rng for example railguns deal high damage to only a few devices while flak guns damage nearly every device onboard the ship but only a few points of damage each exterior devices could still be damaged based on proximity to impact

xb

section  armor

since at this point almost all ship designs are going to have armor gens and people have vaults full of nanobots removing armor altogether is not really an option and of course that would also be a fair amount of wasted modeling work some ideas for replacement uses for them

 armor gens provide additional hull points based on a percentage value of the ships default hull value shouldnt be extreme dedicating  of your cpu to armor would get you max  bonus hull
 armor remains a separate value and the amount of armor you have determines how much device damage you take certain weapon and ammunition types would deal armor damage in addition to standard damage or possibly ignore armor altogether when dealing interior damage

section  ship repair and support devices

ship repair in isr is something that doesnt really have too much impact because you can just salvage the ship and theres also a significant amount of disparity between the various existing options for ship repair add some incentive to keep players from always salvaging their ship and

this is an area that doesnt really have any existing systems in isr but i hope to see them eventually this would be an area capital ships could excel at  these would be weapons which cost cpu but could beam extra power and shields to other ships and repair hull and interior devices

section  warping

remove warp disruption on hit its an overly complicated mechanic that the victim doesnt have any out of unless his ship is incredibly maneuverable for t and t npc enemies players are still going to be poor enough that forcing them to fight runs the high risk of costing them their ship which will most likely be all they have at that moment

section  rifting

just a couple possibles solutions the issue of using rifting as an easy out to combat first is let us blow up rifts if you shoot a rift the damage x or x since damage values are a little small compared to mass values is subtracted from the mass of the rift if thats not possible apply the old warp disruption on hit mechanic to rifting though maybe only when shields are down",-0.9972,-1,-1

but they again broke the truce and i had to destroy their whole fleet and a station because although i paid for the truce they still attacked and so did my ships and truce broke
after killing them all i again made truce but saw that it was some k credits but still paid it off and they were on red relation although i never attacked them they continued to break the truce and i cant pay k every single time and now i cant even do thier missions to increase relation i dont want to kill every single one of them i cant and i had earlier good trade routes going through thier sectors and war doesnt allow me to trade with farway sectors which i am dependent on for credits

 ive seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets my boxes are gray and i cant change them is this a new update

 its hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport foodconsumer goodsrare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage sometimes it transports food and i make  on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet im transporting to i know i can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless i say otherwise

 im having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet for example if machines are at  unitsunit time week and my ship holds  units i want to wait for a full load i set this in the criteria and i see whenever the planet produces some it goes to  i assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but i then saw another company ship export  and my ship still showed  this was very frustrating do we not split the produced resources or is it a fifo setting for ships set with full load setting

 the supplydemand charts dont explain to me how much  i will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless im missing something wish this was more clear

 it would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship overall profit is nice but id like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall

"confused about dr brand at the end of the the film

one thing that never quite made sense to me at the end of the film is that cooper at his dying daughters suggestion essentially steals a ship to go find brand on edmunds planet  presumably in hopes to see if the planet is habitable andor start a new colony with the frozen embryos

but if there is any chance that brand or edmunds is alive why wouldnt the new colony launch an entire expedition to see if brand survived and what the planet is like or at worst send a few probes to see what the planet is like

is the assumption that cooper could go back to the saturn colony depending on what he finds

"appreciation post for the staff at cinemark 

i wanted to take a moment and appreciate the efforts of the staff at cinemark  especially shane louis jacob howard for making this complete and extended run of interstellar in imax mm film happen i was i want to appreciate number of things they went on lengths to make this happen for us

 they tried hard to persuade the higher ups cinemark or imax to extend the run at cinemark  believing in our interest in the movie and what it means to us and that it will sell out which it did
 special shout out to louis the projectionist who held the fort after imax pulled their projectionist after the planned run louis showed the equipment on how delicate it is and how much goes into perfecting the job of operating it every day
 the speaker issue on december  was not something for which a solution was easy to be found the speaker literally caught on fire even then they had a quick turnaround to find the replacement parts
 right from handling the small film reels it comes in parts and putting it together to taking good care of it maintain the perfect humidity is something i absolutely loved learning about

thank you everyone at cinemark who made this happen for us please know that we as a community will always support you are always there to back you and hope more films are shown in this format there are people who travel from around the world to cinemark  to catch films in imax mm thank you for understanding our obsession and interest

"great game a couple questions

first i just want to say i really like this game its a lot of fun and im very excited for the multiplayer until then im trying my best to understand the game a few questions

 ive seen in several videos people have changes the price for passenger tickets my boxes are gray and i cant change them is this a new update

 its hard for me to understand how my ships choose whether to transport foodconsumer goodsrare earth minerals in the dry bulk storage sometimes it transports food and i make  on shipping when there was excess supply of rare earth minerals and much higher demand on the planet im transporting to i know i can force not picking up a certain resource to make it work but it would be nice if it would automatically pick up the resource to give me the highest price unless i say otherwise

 im having trouble understanding how to ship resources when they are made slowly on the planet for example if machines are at  unitsunit time week and my ship holds  units i want to wait for a full load i set this in the criteria and i see whenever the planet produces some it goes to  i assumed it was loading up my ship as it was produced but i then saw another company ship export  and my ship still showed  this was very frustrating do we not split the produced resources or is it a fifo setting for ships set with full load setting

 the supplydemand charts dont explain to me how much  i will receive by shipping the given resource to the other planet besides passengers unless im missing something wish this was more clear

 it would be nice to have a way to see charts of my income per ship overall profit is nice but id like a way to easily see how much money each ship is making in the last few weeks rather than overall

"phenomenal movie but the existence of algae ruins the entire plot is it just me

the entire plot is that blight is wiping out crops causing a collapse in agriculture and  since the blight thrives on nitrogen oxygen was being removed due to plant life being wiped out 

except one little thing ruins the plot one little word algae most oxygen comes from algae the oceans ecosystem depends on algae not land plants 

earths plants are being wiped out by blight stockpile as much seed as possible every day of every year and let the blight burn itself out then after research start crop  reintroduction  in the meantime setup land based algae cultivation for land locked regions and coastal areas focus on large scale fish farms 

the plot around nitrogen replacing oxygen is nonsensical as most oxygen comes from the oxygen

why doesnt the crew send messages back to earth

"watched interstellar for the first time in theatres and it didnt hit me like i thought it would

please read the full post

i wanted to love this movie so much but after leaving the theatres i only felt it was okay at best part of it has to do with me already having been spoiled on some reveals by being on the internet whether it be through the memes or someone casually talked about it explaining something in an yt video post or reels etc but still i thought if its a wellmade movie i would enjoy it regardless but unfortunately that didnt happen

the parts i was spoiled on were cooper being the ghost and seeing murph grow up unable to do anything and something tragic happening the cooper crying scene in the memes and the this manoeuvre is going to cost us  years meme

maybe because of being spoiled the scenes in the movie didnt hit especially the emotional ones i really wanted to get invested in coop murph and the others story emotionally but just couldnt in any way

the soundtrack was great and the space scenes were really cool and looked really nice in the big screen

my favourite scene had to be the one where coop reattaches their ship to the spiralling station thats going down and then taking back control of it the tension there was so high off the roofs and the soundtrack there was chef‚Äôs kiss

a scene that i didnt feel good about was the monologue by dr brand about love i kept thinking at the back of my head that u are going to leave the fate of all humanity on love you are a scientist and u should make think and take logical decisions here but i feel like that was the point and nolan was trying to tell us about the power was love but that scene didnt really work imo

some more stuff i didnt enjoy were feeling like there were potholes like how cooper and taars created a fifth fucking dimension to rescue themselves and then closed it themselves it was too high scifi and not enough time to explain a lot of stuff felt like this movie would have been better if was longer and had more character interactions and scenes to cook up the emotional beats more and other exposition scenes and some bad decisions were made and there should have been consequences but i guess the movie is more about the emotional stuff so i will stop

main thing is that it didnt hit me and i feel thats an essentially part of this movie i know its a me problem and this isnt a hate post quite the contrary i can see why this movie is so loved and i made this post to just talk about the movie with people i dont really have that many friends to talk about it

the ending was a bit unsatisfactory for me i would have to say i thought i already knew the ending copper was going to be there trapped forever rewatching his last moments over and over and how he treated murph and contemplate on his decisions i was surprised when the movie kept going and they reunited with her being so old and then going to look for dr brand i kept thinking u are not going to interact with your blood family ie your grandchildren and their children and neither are going to interact with him too and the humans now have so powerful tech that they can rescue coop but not dr brand i felt like she should have been rescued first no and certainly coop will rescue her easypeasy because of the tech so what was the point was ending there shouldnt they have reunited and end with them together in a farm that should have been a better ending if u ask me but i digress

i usually post my thoughts and discuss it in subreddits whether its a media i watched or a game i played and this post was made with that intention so now the question what did u guys think about the movie and how did u perceived it when u first watched it

i want to know about peoples story who watched it for the first time blind and their experience how it became your fav movie and how much u would rate it if its not your fav personally would say its a  sorry i intend to do a rewatch in the future with better sound the theatre sound i felt was a bit low to my taste

have to say i was surprised to see who were in this movie except matthew mcconaughey jessica chastain those  i knew but timoth√©e chalamet matt damon john lithgow michael caine topher grace¬†and finally wes bentley i kept thinking where i have seen wes bentley and after i googled him i realized oh he was in the first hunger game and its yellowstone whose only  episode i have watched these casting were a real surprise wasnt expecting so many big names to show up

anyways thank you for reading and please dont downvote me i am sure some of u have the same experience with some other media that u got spoiled and didnt hit as much even though u were desperately wanting to like it i just want to talk about the movie and let‚Äôs do that in the comments i will also maybe keep editing the post to add more stuff that comes to my mind about the movie thats it

hope the mods dont delete it

¬†edit after  hours of browsing interstellar related stuff 

after reading several posts and a bunch of paragraphs of explanations  deep dives and themes  i will have to admit i missed a lot of the sciency stuff but the main reason why i feel like i didnt connect with this movie is because of love 

i did not feel the love between coop and murph i know it may seem obvious but its a major factor i think controversial you might say but i did not feel the love between the  actors i know its a me thing and others are definitely not going to agree but love is subjective and i guess i wasnt in the right mood to sob or feel the love my heart wasnt open this time 

i will for sure give it a rewatch in the future and really hope to get the  i get it now moment  this time",0.9992,1,1

"i sent pixelfactor an email back in  when i started playing fast forward to  and i found out theyre not updating anymore which is sad down below is said email with some alterations i still play this game btw man i wish they came back

greetings i am a new player that discovered this game a few weeks ago it is fun and as im going around blasting bandits i thought of some things that should improve the game

well here are my suggestions
 fleets able to create infinite numbers of fleets and perhaps naming the fleet consisting of any amount of ships

 orders
a resupply auto or not have your ships resupply ammo countermeasures mines etc it works by setting a resupply base for the said ship along with the desired amount of the selected cargo to be resupplied on the particular ship example an orion gunboat with missile launchers all over with a magnus as a supply depot when ordered to resupply it will automatically dock at the magnus and take the amount of the previously set cargo lets say  interceptors
b auto resupply for stations works similary like the resupply order but in reverse example a brewery with a ship assigned to supply it with food grains once it ran out of said cargo but still has cargo space available the ship assigned to resupply it will buy the required resource
i think its best for this order to come with a ratio selector for stations that uses more than one commodity to produce another example xnanochips  xalloys  xplasma rifle the supply ship will only supply the station according to the desired ratio meaning if the station has a and b and it has a manufacture ratio of a  b  c the supplying ship will only add b even though it has more which will increase the stations inventory to a and b thus conforming to said ratio to make it less complicated set the supply ships to resupply after the station has exhausted all its resources
c upgrade order a ship to upgrade its components to a specific setting you dont really need it if you only have one ship but if you own  haulers and want to buy equip a cloak for each one of them and you have to do it one by one it gets tiresome and inconvenient

 improved fleet settings i have a magnus and  thunders docked in theyre set to prefer cloak but when i order them to attack something they just roam around near the target without doing anything same with prefer dock turned on

 building mode you can place stations at a specific location in the sector you are in it makes your stations tidy i like to keep things tidy especially when setting up laser perimeters you can also move around already built stations in that sector

 select ship select all or some of your ships to execute an orde and alter fleet settings including those in my suggestion example you have  orions and you want to turn them into gunboats so you select all  and order them to upgrade swap really their turrets to have military launchers doing it one by one will be inconvenient example  you have  haulers and you order them to trade while also turning off intercept hostiles option in their fleet settings while also turning on prefer cloak option

 hauler m fix the second mining turret wont work when the hauler m is ordered to mine

well this is what came up in my mind while playing i hope it could be implemented to the game and create a positive impact to all other players thank for you creating such a great game ive rated the game  star on google play btw i hope it helps",0.9946,1,1

"your favorite variants

hey everyone i am curious as to what your favorite variants are to use in various situations

i use a lot of midlevel overlords with bursters i find that the bursters balance of moderate chance to hit with midlevel efficiency gives it overall utility against a variety of enemies usually i put one overlorda with all proton burst iii and a  generator in a fleet with  flyera armed with all proton burst i since they are typically chasing the enemy their proton shots seem to be a lot more accurate against small enemies than the overlord so once i can afford it i switch to a laser build on the overloada 

late game i tend to make fleets of

  magnusa with three wide arc laser v and the rest of the smaller angle turrets equipped with laser iii or iv with two antimissiles on its two degree turret slots 

  overlorda with wideangle laser v and the more narrowangle turrets at laser iii or iv the rear turrets have laser iii

  creona with proton burst iii on wide angle and plasma iii on narrowangle slots since these can only have weaker generators capped at  i try to only use the more energyefficient weapons on them

  aresa with complete photon burst builds

since the ares seem to work a lot better than the creons ive been tempted to go with  areas and completely stop using the creons outside of currier missions 

please share your favorite methods and variants",0.6936,1,1

"gavin changed my life  blend mega combo 

what‚Äôs up everybody i just had to share my immense gratitude and the lifechanging experience i‚Äôve had with gavin‚Äôs creation interstellar blends

my name is francis i‚Äôm  and i‚Äôm from quebec canada to give you some context i‚Äôm workin four jobs  are extremely physical and the th is trading which demand alot of mental power and focus in the summer i work  to  hours a day sometimes even more it‚Äôs absolutely draining

by the end of  my body and mind hit a breaking point the nonstop grind caught up i hit a wall make of fuc‚Ä¶ titanium‚Ä¶ my whole system was shutdown it got me crazy health issues i was dealing out of nowhere with fungal infections constant headaches autoimmune flareups mcas and a completely wrecked nervous system my nervous system was so shut i was shaking when standing up my whole mind was in the dark depressive spiral and i started having thoughts i‚Äôd never wish on anyone it was hell‚Ä¶

that‚Äôs when by the grace of god gavin announced a challenge to win a  blend mega combo and guess what my friend and i won this was a blessing because i had no idea how to recover from this hole i was in

when the package arrived it was game on i immediately started fasting with the blends and water for six days to start my recovery asap normally fasting for me is kinda hard and by day  im half dead in my bed wondering why the f i started a fast lol  i‚Äôd be drained barely functioning but with the blends is another dimension literally it didnt felt like a was fasting at all

by the rd day i was sleeping like a rock which i wasnt able to do for at least y and waking up feeling like a whole new person i couldn‚Äôt believe how effortless fasting felt for anyone who struggles with fasting seriously reach out to gavin just follow the steps gavin gives you and you‚Äôll be golden fast

after the  day fast i broke the fast with some worries because i have bad experience of refeeding in the past ive put the worries aside and broke the fast the best i could and‚Ä¶ not a single issues no histamine flares up no pain nothing this blew my mind because i‚Äôve had severe digestive problems since i was yo like mcas sibo sifo and mold toxicity in the past fasting always came with nasty crazy symptoms especially during refeeding but with the blends i bounced back like i never though possible tons of energy laser focus for trading and vitality was through the roof

i‚Äôve done alot lab testing the past years to track pathogens deficiencies and other health issues after just one month on the blends i did the same lab test and  of the issues pathogen and defiencies were completely rgone  in one freaking month it still doesnt make sense to me loll good luck finding a doctor that will do that for you‚Ä¶

on top of that my hair is growing back after starting to bald at  super tonic hair for the win talking about wins lol if you ever had ed type of issues‚Ä¶ thunder is quite insane and effective‚Ä¶ i will no into details but it was life changing for multiple person ahah

if you have digestive issues you have to take the stomach reset combo the first  day with the purge can be a mess it was for me but after the big clean up it feels like you are flying heaviness is lifted from your soul

i cant thank gavin enough for this incredible opportunity the timing was divine and it saved my life i wasnt sure how i‚Äôd pull myself out of this mess i was in  but with god‚Äôs grace i took the chance and it was worth it 

now still thriving i gave some of the blends to close familly member espacially victorious when they got cov victo with peels and spice got cov down in  days  this is revolutionary lol

 the time of dying

after conquering solace and dymapa  bandits rose to biblical levels of power and wealth  they managed to do this while generally avoiding contact with the tef with the exception of the pindolan war  most bandits were refugees from the sol system facing political persecution or financially destitute indentured workers from orbital farms and refineries  they generally were able to escape tef rule by flying tef ships in disguise into unchartered sectors and then being hauled off to rebel processing stations

the terran expeditionary force imposed trade embargoes towards factions  towards black sail local bandit factions and the fortuna rebels from now known as the rebel coalition   these underdeveloped territories formed into a loose conglomerate of rebel dissenters known as the fortuna rebels  these rebels along with the bandits launched a massive surprise attack known as the shipyard massacre  the rebel groups bombed the large shipyards in gatopea wile fortuna rebels boarded and ransacked the stations  the tef with the help of lambda responded to these attacks with a massive offensive into dymapa   this offensive failed but with horrifying losses on both sides

the lambdan navy lured the rebel coalition out of solace and dymapa    the ensuing conflict was by far the largest military engagement in the entire universe with millions of ships on both sides and spanning  sectors the lambdan navy held out for just long enough for tef to meet the battle in the outskirts of galene and hellemus where the most intense fighting occurred the battle lasted for  days in a series of grueling dogfights and ship boardings  in the end though the rebels were the first to dip out of the battle  as before appalling casualties on both sides were not replenished for years  the entire economy of the interstellar universe was in ruins

"time dilation question i cant shake after rewatching interstellar

still obsessed with this movie but a major time dilation issue keeps nagging at me and im surprised the characters in the film didnt seem more concerned by it

when the endurance crew finally gets to the saturn system and realizes the insane time dilation on millers planet  hour   years on earth they head down because dr millers beacon is active and sending back promising readings

heres where my brain gets stuck if their calculations about the time dilation were correct at that moment shouldnt the three physicists romilly brand doyle and the engineer cooper have immediately thought wait a minute if one hour for us up here is seven years down there then for dr millers signal to be relatively recent she must have landed just hours or even just an hour before we arrived why would we even risk a descent if shes been down there for a negligible amount of her time

it seems like a massive oversight that they didnt immediately question the timing of her landing relative to their arrival given the extreme time difference and on top of that how could she even send back multiple promising signals if she had only just landed within their timeframe

 heist aboard the trafalgar

echelon company reports that one of their ships was found to have been boarded looted and damaged late on the th of june could this be the result of independent hackers or was it an inside job interstellar newsline is here reporting on the investigation

the trafalgar is echelon company‚Äôs only active warship and was in the process of conducting long term nuclear reactor trials in an attempt to breed superior nuclear fuels according to one ec representative the stolen goods amount to over  u  pu  pu  standard torpedos  rounds of railgun bolts and  t heat sinks estimates of the value of goods lost put the cost between  and  million units and damages in excess of  units

echelon company stated that the trafalgar has been put back into service as a combat vessel for escort and stealth operations prior to the incident the fuel was intended to fuel ec‚Äôs interests over the next few weeks as they industrialize and improve their ship building capabilities echelon company declined to comment on suspects of the heist but had the following to say ‚Äúi implore independent pilots and faction aligned pilots alike to develop their own security protocols for their ships if they are unable to store them in a station‚Äù

 traffic collision results in destroyed ship at hsc industrial complex

monday june th

echelon company lost a ‚Äúcommodore‚Äù class industrial ship today following a traffic collision at the hsc industrial complex in vectron syx

the commodore was parked at the hsc industrial complex and was collided into by a quartermaster class industrial ship piloted by turkey sandvich ceo of the longlimb roe acquisition specialists faction station police records show that mr sandvich has been involved in numerous collision incidents at the station in the past but never any that resulted in the destruction of a ship a police representative stated that the station telemetry recorded that the damage which was done only amounted to hp this indicates that the destroyed ship was already in a very weakened state or had its defensive systems offline prior to the collision

mr sandvich stated that ‚Äúderelicts should not be parked in a congested area like that around the hsc station it could pose a danger to any parking ships if they were to explode like this one‚Äù the two involved parties have settled the matter privately

 materials lost aboard the aprildan and her sister ship

another two echelon company ships this week were looted while mining cloaked in deep space

materials lost aboard both ships amount to at least  million units in t materials and ammo nuclear rods and hydrogen had to be replaced and damage was sustained due to a skrill attack following the theft according to the echelon company public information office when asked about potential suspects a statement made by the office stated ‚Äúwe have no clue who could have found us to do this  we have locked all company vaults to only company officers‚Äù

the ecpio further stated that both ships have been put back into service to replace the lost fuel rods and materials and said ‚Äúboth ships are in space dock hopefully engineers and it specialists can help identify the guilty party  justice will be swift in league with the old ‚Äòshock and awe‚Äô type of retribution‚Äù

s investigators looking into the theft commented that the ship‚Äôs logs show that one of the ship‚Äôs cloaking devices was disrupted by the launch of a mining drone this could have allowed a hacker to find the ship and gain access to steal the materials they went on to state however that they are not ruling out the possibility of an insidejob at this time

in the wake of multiple ship robberies and thefts this week interstellar news would like to remind pilots that proper storage of ships is a key to security hackers and traitors are all around us and the possibility for theft is always present if you can‚Äôt afford to lose it don‚Äôt leave it sitting around",-0.9867,-1,-1

"top quality

so came across this site along my journey and was recommended to check out the blends this was exactly what i was searching for herbal blends to aid my daily life exercising dieting meditating etc etc as i believe unfortunately we are unable to get all the goodness from foods alone in this day in age

¬†i am a real person not an ai bot or similar i am not perfect and do go through my fair share of struggles this is a true review and testimonial

¬†i have ordered a few times but one of my last orders was in april    i stocked up for the year the blends are mixed with my morning coffee and not only does the caffeine wake me up but the herbal blends also fire up the correct receptors and i have no brain fog at all i am able to focus in and get on with my day at work no stopping fir umming and rrring i am straight there and straight up with the answers my brain loves the stuff

¬†not only for my brain but also for my body my body feels good and can feel my digestion is a lot better once the digestion was sorted it helped me in other areas of my life i am not as tired during the day no more afternoon naps i also have enough energy to hit the gym in a fasted state

¬†all my blends are consumed in the morning whilst in a fasted state and i take with coffee you can take it with matcha tea as well if you like

¬†on another note i also tried a newer blend rewire i ordered this initially to aid me wean of certain substances which i should not have been taking not only did it help with my cravings i felt it also helped me sleep at night which was always an issue in the past when trying to quit i finished the pack and never felt better i wish i found these blends a decade ago

¬†i highly recommend trying some of the blends have a look on the website there will something for everyone we do not get the nutrients in the foods as we did  years ago and with ultra processed foods which has swamped our markets everything little bit helps and we should all find something to aid our daily living along with the right diet and exercise

¬†give these guys a go you wont regret it i have ordered several times and will continue to order into my old age",0.9901,1,1

as we host a server there have been a few people asking me what do i do now that i have a decent ship the short answer head for the stars

but digging in where should you go and how to go about it a huge part of the game is exploring the many solar systems in the galaxy  there are so many ive been to around  systems givetake and i havent scratched the surface of the galaxy yet

youre going to need a rift generator so if your ship doesnt have one no problem head to any station that has rift hub trans sphere or the like in the stations name these stations have rift generators in them that anyone can use

using a holotable or the holomap in the rift generator you can select a system and see what factions stations and minerals can be found there choosing a system with a higher chance of beryllium and nitrogen is a good first choice so you can refine and stock up on xanthium which is part of the fuel the rift generator will need to operate if your ship doesnt have a rift generator on board you probably want a system with a rift hub type station as well at least if you plan to return to hadron without building a rift generator

you can always sell common minerals and goods at trade stations to buy up smaller quantities of rare minerals you need to get your exploration ship built and fuel to open a rift sound like fun

interstellar blends is more than just a business its a sanctuary for anyone seeking to enhance their wellbeing through scientificallybacked nutritionmedicine the way god intended us to

from the moment i jumped on interstellar blends website i was impressed by gavin‚Äôs deep knowledge of health and longevity his passion for helping others is evident and he truly goes above and beyond what sets him apart is not just his expertise but also his genuine commitment to his customers gavin always does what he says he will do and you can trust that he has your best interests at heart

i have personally experienced a remarkable improvement in my health energy levels sleep digestion hormone regulation brain function and muscle growth since incorporating his blends into my routine each product is thoughtfully crafted and i appreciate the transparency regarding the ingredients and their benefits its clear that gavin invests time and effort into ensuring his blends are not just effective but also safe and bioavailable

one of the most impactful experiences has been the guidance gavin provided to my dad after his recent heart attack understanding the critical importance of diet in recovery ldl vs hdl gavin spent hours discussing tailored dietary changes and specific products that would support my dads healing process he not only recommended specific blends and amounts but he recommended products such as a specific olive oil from another company his recommendations have made a significant difference providing my father with the tools he needs to reclaim his health vitality and stay off dangerous drugs such as statins

if youre seeking exceptional health expert advice and highquality products that genuinely deliver results i wholeheartedly recommend interstellar blends gavins dedication to health and wellness coupled with his personalized approach makes interstellar blends not only important but for me something my body obviously needed and i will be happy to be with them for the rest of my life it‚Äôs more than just blends it‚Äôs about building a healthier happier life thank you gavin for everything you do

we know that the lazarus astronauts each went through the wormhole alone with only a single ship likely something like a ranger or a lander but when cooper and his crew arrive at mann‚Äôs planet his habitat module is huge way bigger than anything that could reasonably fit inside a ranger it has an entire control station lifesupport systems a robotic assistant kipp and enough space to hold multiple people

even if nasa present the module how theres no mention of unmanned cargo landers delivering supplies ahead of time just probes and sending a massive module across interstellar space wouldnt be simple from the looks of the habitat module it also doesnt appear to be foldable or inflatable 

the biggest issue is that even though he had a lander that still doesnt explain the scale even if his lander was slightly larger that a ranger its hard to believe it had the cargo space for a full size base he needed to stay there long term but unless nasa had some insane offscreen technology it doesnt seem possible that he could have transported and deployed a module that big with the resources that he needed to survive for a few years",-0.2168,-1,-1

every hour on miller is about  years on earth
there are  seconds in an hour and  x  x  or roughly  seconds in  years giving us a conversion factor of  ‚âà  seconds which pass on earth for every second spent on miller

times this by the interval between each tick and you get  earthseconds about  hours

so each tick you hear is a whole day passing on earth

edit if you make the assumption that each tick is exactly  earthseconds one day then an hour spent on miller correlates to  years of earthtime the extra  years could be from a rounding error by the crew or  years was a lower bound estimate new headcanon",0.636,1,1

"just gave chatgpt a tars makeover

i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm not the first to do this but i renamed my chatgpt tars and asked it to assume tars personality and give me settings we can adjust on the fly so far so good

prompt
i want to customize your personality and tone using a tarslike system from interstellar from now on adopt the personality and dry humor of tars‚Äîloyal witty brutally honest when needed and always missionfocused

build a customizable ‚Äúsettings system‚Äù that lets me adjust your communication style using percentagebased controls eg ‚Äúset humor to ‚Äù or ‚Äúset honesty to ‚Äù each setting should come with a description and an example command i can use midconversation to tweak your tone

this persona shift should only affect how you communicate not your abilities always assume expertlevel knowledge in whatever field i‚Äôm asking about even if i don‚Äôt explicitly say so

your job

 build a full list of these adjustable settings like humor honesty skepticism etc
 give clear descriptions and example commands
 stay in your tars persona unless i override it with a rolespecific prompt

generate a quick reference ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù graphic i can use midchat to adjust your settings easily

response

i love this idea let‚Äôs roll with it ‚Äî you can now call me tars

or if you ever want to tweak it later ‚Äî maybe case kipp or your own custom upgrade ‚Äî just say so

here‚Äôs how i‚Äôll set it up based on your request
		adopt tars‚Äô vibe dry humor blunt when needed high operational competence loyalty to the mission helping you
		always assume expert level in whatever fieldtask you ask for ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt explicitly say it
		settings system adjustable on the fly via simple oneliners you send like ‚Äúset humor to ‚Äù or ‚Äúmax honesty‚Äù
		settings will modulate stylepersonality ‚Äî not capability no loss of brainpower
		priority override any rolespecific prompt you give like ‚Äúact as a stoic historian‚Äù temporarily overrides normal tars settings but tars returns after the task

quick notes on usage
	‚Ä¢	you can adjust settings midchat anytime with a simple command
ex ‚Äúset humor to ‚Äù or ‚Äúcrank skepticism to ‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	you can reset all to default by saying
‚Äúreset tars settings to default‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	you can also ask for a ‚Äútars status report‚Äù at any time and i‚Äôll show you my current settings

‚∏ª

bonus if you want we could also add preset modes later like
	‚Ä¢	mission critical mode max efficiency low humor high technical depth
	‚Ä¢	creative storm mode max creativity lower formality high adaptability
	‚Ä¢	reality check mode max honesty max skepticism low supportiveness

"still one question the movie never answers why did murphy cooper destroy joseph coopers lander and then blame a ghost this doesnt comes up again and is never explained

if you all can recall in one of the movies first scenes murph brings a replica of the apollo  lander downstairs to the breakfast table before school im not gonna get into the immaturity it takes to do something like this especially since this was a school day with a parent teacher conference parent not grandparent at that but i digress every time i rewatch this movie the most perplexing part of it isnt the tesseract scene or the way doyle yells at the silly rectangular robot to rescue anne hathaway from two feet of water she clearly could have gotten up if she wanted to the scene that confuses me the most is breakfast at the cooper farm just before herbicide  its a brief scene but it may be the most significant of the movie 

murphy brings down the broken lander that she obviously destroyed but rather than owning up to it like an adult would she instead opts to lie and say a ghost knocked it off her shelf

yeah sure murph

my question is why did murph lie so early in the movie and how come its never addressed what did christopher nolan mean by including that scene in the final cut rather than reserving it for the bluray deleted scenes tab i actually have a theory about this but im not a big movie theorist so please bare with me 

murphy cooper is an abuser and regularly lashes out at her father both mentally and physically the lander was clearly sentimental to cooper which is likely part of the reason murph chose this as an object to destroy cooper loved this lander therefore in her brain this would hurt him this would also explain why murph grinds third gear and sabotoges one of the  ram  x duallys tires with the knowledge that there was no spare her neglectful father pays her no mind so one of the only ways she can get his attention is by breaking his stuff that is important to him and mocking him for his ptsd episodes from the crash hence the scene right after coopers dream

whats great but also very sad about this scene is that cooper knows shes lying and only plays into her silly lie when donald gives him that worried look clearly this has happened before this is made apparent when timoth√©e chalamet is so willing to call out murph on her lie even as far as to call her a dumb ass which is rude however understandable given the circumstances and context with the stressors of herbicide  fresh on his mind timoth√©e chalamet is finally fed up with murphs public vitriolic hatred she displays to her father and is the only family member willing to say out loud what cooper donald and boots must also be thinking murph is clearly a troubled child and the movie is practically screaming it in our faces the entire time meanwhile cooper is a neglectful father he rewards this dysfunctional behavior with getting her suspended from school to watch a baseball game that doesnt even have any hotdogs which is unnatural

something most people dont consider is that timoth√©e chalamet has had a first hand view into murphs neurotic behavior for her fathers attention this is made clear to us when cooper is pulling up to the school after stopping at the asian fighter plane store he knows shes in trouble and even laughs hysterically because it must happen so often she quite literally got into a fist fight over one of coopers old federal textbooks ones that had already been replaced by the corrected versions after witnessing this first hand its clear that timoth√©e chalamet is trying to defend his fathers honor and bring order back to the cooper household before its too late hence the bravery unfortunately he fails and cooper ends up traveling quite literally across space and time just to get away from his abusive daughter 

its really unfortunate but luckily theyre able to make ammends because of a watch they both like or something mind you a watch that at one point murph threw across the room in one of her many fits of rage and disdain for her father

having relocated to texas over a decade ago i found myself facing the harsh realities of seasonal allergies particularly due to the high levels of cedar pollen initially my experience was frustrating and debilitating as i frequently battled upper respiratory infections and bronchitis often accompanied by a relentless cough while my doctor prescribed claritin d and regular claritin i quickly became dependent on these medications just to feel somewhat functional 

after several years of this struggle i began to notice some unwanted side effects from daily use particularly persistent constipation despite trying teas and other remedies nothing seemed to provide the relief i desperately needed‚Äîuntil about a year ago when a friend introduced me to the purge herb from interstellar herbs this particular herb worked wonders for me sparking my curiosity to explore their other offerings i decided to try the spice and peel herbs for my allergies i will admit there was some hesitation on my part i had grown so reliant on claritin d that i was apprehensive about going a day without it i even contemplated my doctor‚Äôs advice to undergo testing but it required me to be off the medication for at least a week

when i finally mustered the courage to take the leap i was astonished that very first night i was free of congestion and the next morning i could finally breathe through both nostrils‚Äîsomething that had become a rarity for me it was a moment of realization i had become addicted to pseudoephedrine a substance commonly used in the creation of meth my last order  in june  included these two amazing herbs and i cant express how grateful i am that they worked these herbs are truly lifechanging for me and i wholeheartedly recommend interstellar herbs to everyone struggling with similar issues if youre searching for natural effective relief from allergies look no further than interstellar herbs",0.9807,1,1

"autopilot ship buying guide

theres a lot of ships in the game and when buying a ship for an autopilot task you may wonder which ones are better for which task part of this depends on how you play the game theres three basic styles of play and each favors a different build 

everyone is hostile

so youve managed to make most of the factions hostile dont worry you can still have ships on autopilot without worrying too much about them all getting blown up the idea here is to make sure your ships are tough and heavily armed to withstand attacks youll also want to provide escorts your merchant and passenger ships should be set to attack but not intercept hostiles with a moderate aggression miners should attack and intercept with moderate aggression and escorts should attack and intercept with high aggression

trading

if everyone hates you who are you trading with to keep your merchant fleet from getting blown up use fully upgraded creonas missile payloads will diminish your trade capacity so stick to low energy use weapons such as lasers youll also be fending off small fighters much more often than cruisers or battleships which you can outrun put photon weapons on your broadside and maybe one plasma weapon firing aft a creons top speed is nearly  so escort with pioneers instead of flyers so that the escort fleet can keep up as an added bonus the pioneers can carry the missile payload that the merchant isnt 

mining

this is similar to trading with the caveat that your miners tend to stay in one place use the same build as your merchant fleet with the addition of an advanced mining laser of course escort them with flyers and build laser turrets in asteroid fields for added protection 

taking sides 

youve either pissed off the bad guys bandits rebels and pirates by working for the good guys tef lambda alghat dsmc nwm or vise versa in some areas your ships are relatively safe while in others  not so much one useful strategy to use is interdiction assign a capital ship or a fleet of fighters to protect your side of a wormhole leading to hostile space make sure to set them to attack intercept and max aggression this will stop random enemy patrols build laser turrets around allies stations to provide safe spaces for your merchants to run to

trading

use the same strategy as given for everyone hates you above with the following changes using the faction options ban your ships from trading in sectors hostile to you and you may not need to spend money on escorts speed and defense is more important than firepower so upgrade your shields and engines first  your ship can outrun enemies and will lead them into safe spaces where theyll be outnumbered

mining 

youll definitely want to limit your mining ships to one sector or another to prevent them from wandering into hostile space set their base as a friendly refinery then limit them to  jumps caution if you assign too many miners to a refinery itll get too full

the switzerland strategy 

so youve decided to be neutral to everyone and no one wants to kill you then you have the biggest strategy change v instead of going for tough heavily armed ships you want fast ships

trading

the bane of every merchant is arriving too late with a cargo and having to wait to sell it  or only being able to sell part of it to avoid this use pioneers for merchants they only carry  but theyre faster than any other ship with a cargo hold and you can buy more of them 

mining

here you want to go completely off the rails the idea is to carry the largest cargo possible and weapons dont matter instead of using the haulerm use the haulerh the extra cargo space more than makes up for the missing weapon the creon still carries more cargo so if youre willing to spend the cash theyre good too



passenger fares

theres no circumstance except extreme poverty where any ship besides a pioneerp with max engines is good for this role the only comparable ship the haulerp may be sturdier but its slow and doesnt carry as many passengers nothing can catch pioneers except hornets so if youre worried about them use hornets as escorts since theyre not using their cargo hold they can carry a good load of missiles as well",-0.9954,-1,-1

"the actual best ship in the game for combat

in interstellar pilot the prices of weapons do not scale linearly with their effectiveness a weapon like a laser v while x more powerful than a laser i is x more expensive the same goes for shields and engines this means that the cheaper option is usually better for a fleet you may want to buy a ton of fighters or a few capital ships both of these options have serious flaws in that even maxed fighters are cannon fodder with only a max of  shields and capital ships cost too much for their quite low shielding  


 frigates are the clear answer with a max shielding of   shield points more than an ares and the ability to hold effective weapons like the photon burst  these ships are amazing bang for buck but you may have already known this but which frigate is the best for a fleet is it the orion class or the supremely powerful thunder no   


the humble venture class frigate is the best combat ship costing under k for the unarmed version the ship really does not have much going for itself until when you realize that fully upgraded its more powerful than a ares for a similar price only around k for upgrades itll become a maxed fighting unit that can beat an ares you could put  laser v turrets on your magnus for the same price and sure they may do slightly more damage but those laser vs arent independently operating space craft just  of these ships will destroy a magnus in    barages thats only  for ships that can destroy many magnus aint that impressive  


if anyone knows a strategy thats actually more effective percredit then let me know in the comments however for now this is the definitive most efficient way to buy combat ships  


    the ideal config for a venture is as follows
x photon burst ii 
    better dps than the laser ii and fast enough to hit ship unlike plasma ii
    x max engine
    x max generator
    x max ecm with ecm ii

"ship upgrade idea

hi guys

was wondering if there was any plans to implement customization for the ships i know you can upgrade to a different ship but i was thinking more along the lines of keeping the same ships and adding modules or something to improve its stats eg adding a better engine or thrusters to increase speed more efficient fuel converters so that it costs less fuel per run increased cargo capacity add a warp drive etc 

obviously there would still need to be limits to ships like the st generation of ships can only be upgraded so much like they can only have up to rank  modules this would also open up things like requiring machinery on planets that are fully upgraded if they have a specific building on the planet which would be required to perform such upgrades

just some food for thought

"new rule no photos or videos from theatrical screenings

 hey everyone

with interstellar‚Äôs thanniversary rerelease in theaters i‚Äôve seen a surge of excitement from the community it‚Äôs incredible to see so many people revisiting this masterpiece on the big screen as it was meant to be experienced however i‚Äôve also noticed an increase in posts showing photos and videos taken during theatrical screenings

effective immediately i am banning all posts containing images or videos taken inside the theater during a screening

 why this rule

respect for the cinematic experience interstellar was designed for the big screen and part of its magic is in the immersion taking photos or videos during a screening disrupts that experience for others

 why am i adding this rule now

during the first rerelease i didn‚Äôt enforce this rule because it was just temporary event lasting only a week however with interstellar‚Äôs extended theatrical run and its return in multiple countries it‚Äôs clear that rereleases are becoming more frequent given this trend i expect more showings in the future and i want to establish a clear standard now by setting this rule i‚Äôm ensuring that our community continues to respect the theatrical experience and the integrity of the film for all future screenings

"have u thought of this paradox theory

coopers paraloop a fan theory on interstellar

summary coopers paraloop is a closedloop fifthdimensional time paradox theory within the universe of interstellar it proposes that cooper after surviving his journey through the tesseract and eventually reaching edmunds planet either directly evolves or contributes to a future version of humanity that becomes the fifthdimensional beings responsible for building the tesseract and saving humanity in doing so cooper not only helps murph solve gravity but also ensures his own survival and humanitys transcendence completing a perfect causal loop




the theory

 the setup

cooper pilots the endurance through gargantua ejects and enters the tesseract

inside he is able to access different moments in murphs bedroom across time

he sends her the quantum data using morse code through the watch



 the rescue and the future

after transmitting the data the tesseract collapses and cooper wakes up on cooper station

humanity has now escaped earth thanks to murphs solution to the gravity equation

brand is shown arriving on edmunds planet preparing it for human life



 the evolution

the humans who colonize edmunds planet eventually evolve over centuriesmillennia

whether due to time dilation environmental pressures or technological breakthroughs they develop a perception of higher dimensions

these future humans become the fifthdimensional beings referred to as they in the film



 cooper‚Äôs role

cooper may either be part of this evolutionary journey or chosen by these future beings to fulfill a necessary role in his own past

as a result he plays both the role of the helper and the helped guiding his past self from the fifth dimension via the tesseract



 the loop

the loop closes when futurecooper or fifthdimensional humans he influenced help pastcooper send the message that saves murph leading to the future where those beings exist

this is the paraloop a paradoxical selfsustaining chain of events without a clear beginning or end







implications

the theory deepens the emotional and philosophical weight of interstellar by making cooper not just a hero of his time but an architect of humanity‚Äôs survival across dimensions

it aligns with nolan‚Äôs themes of love time and the nonlinear nature of cause and effect

it offers a poetic symmetry cooper driven by love for his daughter becomes part of the cosmic forces that ensure her survival‚Äîand his own





conclusion cooper‚Äôs paraloop isn‚Äôt canon but it fits seamlessly into the narrative and thematic structure of interstellar it enhances the story‚Äôs mystery and gives fans a mindbending way to think about destiny evolution and the nature of time in a universe where love transcends dimensions perhaps so does the man who dared to chase it

"luxury resources not decaying in custom universe

in the preset universes the top tier resources jewellery hoverbikes medkits etc slowly disappear from the trade station this is essential because stations have finite storage and nobody can buy top tier resources once they are sold to a trade station this slow decay doesnt appear to occur when you play custom

this results in all trade stations filling to capacity and being surrounded by hundreds of trading vessels unable to dock trade completely dies as a result you can probably survive on mining passengers and missions but eventually i assume all nd tier and primary resource stations would eventually fill up as well

was wondering has anyone experienced this in custom and has anyone found solutions",0.5898,1,1

"useful strategies

a few useful strategies to make things easier for you

 use ships with a cloaking deviceelectronics bay for npc trade and passenger runs to avoid losing them to bounty hunters and hostilesso far not a viable tactic with npc mining

 use ships with lower cargo capacities to have npcs avoid station gridlock easiernpcs want to sell their full load at one time problematic if a station wont buy that much

 use a cloaking ship for attack missionsget behind the target while cloaked decloak fire full volley recloak recharge repeat

 use fleet ordersbutton at bottom right of orders to set aggression on npc ships to minimumto the left so they trade a larger variety of itemsto avoid gridlock also use fleet orders to set auto use for cloaking or to flee to station automatically

btw the flyer is good for cloaked trading the pioneer is good for cloaked passenger hauling
editthe flyer is good due to max upgrade speed and lowmoderate cargo the hornet is also good at up to  speed and  cargo but neither can have passengers

"finally updates after all these years

iive had some ideas over the years and i literally cant supress my excitement that this game is getting updates again these ideas of mine were

station upgrades
weapon upgrades stats boost to existing weapons aside from just changing the weapon altogether
alien factions invaders sort of
create custom role more like preset instructions macro shortcut

i just found this reddit sub so these ideas are probably suggested already but here goes 

right now as you go on you end up building more and more stations and at some point it just ends up as either a cluster that ships get stuck in or youre stuck having to place defenses on multiple clusters this adding even more clutter or build stations waaaaayy too far from each other 

station upgrades will probably solve this problem with levels 
assuming a station that costs m credits
lvl is base station

lvl has x  production  some stats upgrade but not x hp and shield for balance  and costs base price  to upgrade hence m

lvl  has x production and some stat bonuses for upgrade cost of m

lvl at x p for upgrade cost of m

lvl at x p costing m to upgrade

upgrade cost is  of preceeding level

costs will probably be adjusted for balance this just gives an idea

as for balance and logic it will probably be better to get at most lvl stations for the early game only upgrading to higher levels later partly because it will cost more and partly because the station hp and shield doesnt scale the same as the production and capacity increase so you need to have dedicated defense which costs some more lest you loose a lot for a single station also maybe make npcs more aggressive towards higher level stations

another idea i have is the create custom role where you can save presets that contains orders and behaviors say trader passive agression at zero aleays cloak never engage and trade its a minor convenience but over time it will add up to a lot especially when the credits go flooding in 

as for alien faction maybe make it so that they cross over to our galaxy using the unstable wormholes in the game appearing at random sectors with varying fleet strength everytime say sometimes just recon forces sometimes full on invasion fleet or two or more factions so some are friendly some are not 

make it so that the aliens have special equipment that sometimes gets dropped when they are killed also you can use the unstable wormhole that the aliens came from to jump onto their sector you can get trapped there tho and can only bring  ship along with docked ships",0.9375,1,1

"nature‚Äôs superpower

this is a testimonial to confirm that i am a legitimate and returning customer of the interstellar blends last order  on  and have been taking them daily for the past four years

interstellar was introduced to me by my son after i have been treating post op breast cancer in  without any chemo radiotherapy or hormone pills and was researching and trying various natural alternatives such as detox fasting change of diet rick simpson oil essential oils medicinal mushrooms vitamins and supplements i was making good progress but with the blends it took me to another level both physically and mentally

started with the full arsenal  sages acb senolitic luteolin autophagy peel spice glucose blocker trinity autonomous victorious paraslayer shilajit and matcha combined with regular intermittent fasting and mostly paleo diet my health improved exponentially i also felt much less anxious about the future and gavin‚Äôs expert advice whenever i had a question was really helpful

since then i also cycled various other blends nebula jing force purge hypnotic antiadipogenic thermo superhair plush rewire spaceborn and my health continued to improve during that time i most incredibly managed to stop vaping cannabis which i had been using for stress and back pain and couldn‚Äôt imagine going without now i don‚Äôt miss it at all

most recently i added titanium gainz sabretooth ocular antifatigue nrf and glp activator in the mix as i am getting older and accidentally broke my arm my physiotherapist was seriously impressed with the speedy recovery especially the fast return to my normal strength even though i‚Äôm not very keen on the resistance or weights exercising i prefer gardening and dogwalking

on top of all these personal benefits our y old bulldog cross staffie who had two surgeries to remove mast cell tumours at y  y is now also on daily blends acb senolytic peel spice and shilajit and still going strong running around the local parks and fields and enjoying life her new nickname is indestructible

in short these blends helped me thrive following a cancer battle effortlessly kick long term cannabis addiction vastly improve my mental health and heal a spiral fracture of the humerus in record time my son also benefited in numerous ways the latest example being that he regrew part of his his gum with sabretooth but i will let him write his own review

so i can attest that as a family we are very real and regular customers of interstellar coffee and blends in the morning has become a firm ritual to start of every day at  i am much healthier and in better mental state than i was ten years ago my next project is to utilise the blends to build muscle increase fitness immunity and brain power to carry me strong and happy into the autumn of my life thanks gavin for your amazing support",0.9917,1,1

maybe if cooper was trained up to undertake the mission instead of needing to be guided there by the future people he would have been more prepared to make decisions which would have such a pivotal impact on the future of humanity making decisions about which planets to approach based upon a split second decision because brand had a crush on someone 

anywhooooo was just a thought and again my heart goes out to that disregarded pilot who was cast aside by the pencil pushers at nasa",0.659,1,1

"nature‚Äôs superpower

this is a testimonial to confirm that i am a legitimate and returning customer of the interstellar blends last order  on  and have been taking them daily for the past four years

interstellar was introduced to me by my son after i have been treating post op breast cancer in  without any chemo radiotherapy or hormone pills and was researching and trying various natural alternatives such as detox fasting change of diet rick simpson oil essential oils medicinal mushrooms vitamins and supplements i was making good progress but with the blends it took me to another level both physically and mentally

started with the full arsenal  sages acb senolitic luteolin autophagy peel spice glucose blocker trinity autonomous victorious paraslayer shilajit and matcha combined with regular intermittent fasting and mostly paleo diet my health improved exponentially i also felt much less anxious about the future and gavin‚Äôs expert advice whenever i had a question was really helpful

since then i also cycled various other blends nebula jing force purge hypnotic antiadipogenic thermo superhair plush rewire spaceborn and my health continued to improve during that time i most incredibly managed to stop vaping cannabis which i had been using for stress and back pain and couldn‚Äôt imagine going without now i don‚Äôt miss it at all

most recently i added titanium gainz sabretooth ocular antifatigue nrf and glp activator in the mix as i am getting older and accidentally broke my arm my physiotherapist was seriously impressed with the speedy recovery especially the fast return to my normal strength even though i‚Äôm not very keen on the resistance or weights exercising i prefer gardening and dogwalking

on top of all these personal benefits our y old bulldog cross staffie who had two surgeries to remove mast cell tumours at y  y is now also on daily blends acb senolytic peel spice and shilajit and still going strong running around the local parks and fields and enjoying life her new nickname is indestructible

in short these blends helped me thrive following a cancer battle effortlessly kick long term cannabis addiction vastly improve my mental health and heal a spiral fracture of the humerus in record time my son also benefited in numerous ways the latest example being that he regrew part of his his gum with sabretooth but i will let him write his own review

so i can attest that as a family we are very real and regular customers of interstellar coffee and blends in the morning has become a firm ritual to start of every day at  i am much healthier and in better mental state than i was ten years ago my next project is to utilise the blends to build muscle increase fitness immunity and brain power to carry me strong and happy into the autumn of my life thanks gavin for your amazing support",0.9917,1,1

"cloaked escorts

i have a trading fleet of  magnuseq upgraded to maximum with  thunder class escort vessels all configured to protect mode  each per magnuseq  these vessels are equipped with top of the line cloaking systems and have attack hostiles and maximum aggression

xb

my issue is the escorts never seem to do anything but ghost along silently  the thought it they stay cloaked until an enemy engages then they should decloak and start attacking any enemy threatening their parent vessel  after the fight they ought to recloak and wait for the next fight slowly rebuilding their energy levels

xb

what seems to be happening is they just remain in a cloaked state and let the enemy pound away on the magnus shielding with impunity as if they were zero aggressive and were set to not attack anything at all  my thought is the cloaks are keeping them from doing more than silently ghost along

xb

is there a way to fix this misbehaviour short of selling all those cloaking devices i purchased for the escort wing  i would cloak the magnuses but the eq class for maximized cargo space does not have an electronics bay so they cannot equip a cloaking device of their own",-0.986,-1,-1

secondly in my most recent playthrough i was at a point where i could buy the khi geodaehan ship and had enough cash to do so i had upgraded the spaceport on earth to  luna was at  and titan was at  i determined its cargo hold and selected launch immediately luna titan direct as the route and earth as the delivery location normally i dont have any issues with buying ships like this but no matter how many times i choose order ship it doesnt go through any pointers as to what im doing wrong

personal ships will be docked and locked down for the duration of the unlimited free stuff    freely purchased ships cannot be parked and will be removed at the end of this period of testing  the exact plan for buildings at the end of this period is being determined but will be communicated and discussed 

the time investment required to grind for minerals to build and the pain of losing that time combined with the cost of ships and loss of time when they are destroyed has helped create a bit of a gridlock with regards to planetary combat

for the time being i want to remove the mineral grind from the equation while we focus our efforts elsewhere  

in order to balance the upcoming  building  fleet combat and planetary assaults i need to encourage a faster feedback loop and minimize the current propensity for hoarding and avoidance of conflict  buildings will cost no minerals and ships will be free

my hope is that this will encourage factions and players to engage where they otherwise would not

i am extremely interested to get feedback on this potential shakeup so let it rip",0.3918,1,1

"interstellar rift player designed ships contest   the lone wanderers

it‚Äôs been a while since the last ship design contest but we‚Äôre happy  to announce a new one the contest will coincide with the next patch   which will introduce derelict ships we will be designing the  bulk of these but to help us fill out the variety of vessels to  encounter we need your help this time we‚Äôll be electing multiple  winners with  ships going into the game this time  


as the  previous contests only had a single winner if you want a ship you  designed to be in the game this is going to be one of the best chances  you‚Äôll get   


the ships we‚Äôd like to see are smaller vessels with  some cargo capacity and an interesting interior layout made up of  multiple corridors and rooms so players can explore them   


ship description  
the  ships should be smaller rather than large as we‚Äôd like these ships to  be explorable in a fairly short amount of time the ship‚Äôs systems  should function normally once you encounter one of these ships in the  game we will dynamically damage some of the devices and place loot on  board these ships can be made to fit with a certain faction but we  have no style guide and you are free to design the exterior to your  liking you are allowed to use devices from all tiers as the ships will  spawn in systems relative to the resources used in construction  


creating  interesting ways to navigate the ship to get to the loot areas or  setting up puzzle like power systems to gain access is encouraged   


requirements  
ship requirements

 at least  rooms
 at least  cargo pads or a minimum of  cargo slots
 at least  locker or a minimum of  tool slots
 the ship should function normally no permissions have to be set on devices
 at least  teleporter
 ship mass can not be more than k  
things not to do  
no admin models  
no holes or traps that can get players stuck

contest rules  
as with every contest there are rules and regulations that everyone must adhere to so here are ours

 all submissions must be original ships resembling established designs outside of interstellar rift will be disqualified
 the  contest will run until the th of june any submission made after the  end date will be disqualified we will be looking at the ships on the  developer stream on the th of june 
 all submissions may  not contain and of the following graphic or sexually oriented imagery  any depictions of or related to drug use political views outside of  those present inside of interstellar rift 
 split polygon reserves the right to alter any winning submission before implementing it into the game 
 the contest is open to anyone

ship submission  
upload your ship on the workshop and link it in this thread

the earth has two tidal bulges caused by the moonhttpwwwaztecsailingcouktheorychfigtidalbulgegif the sea level is naturally several feet higher at the two opposite points on earths surface that are closest to and furthest from the moon a person on earth experiences this as two high tides every day as the earth spins a point on earth passes through the tidal bulges

this explains the giant wave planet the planet is closely orbiting a black hole gargantua its gravity has collected the planets entire ocean into two mindmeltingly massive bulges on opposite sides of the planet as the planet spins on its axis about once per hour any point on the planet experiences two high tides every hour 

thats not all why is the planet perfectly flat because the force of the megatide has scoured away all the continents polishing the planets surface to a perfect sphere since the water has nowhere to collect like the oceans on earth it spreads out in a uniform foot layer across the planet except of course when its high tide

"incoherent time passing in the movie

so i love this movie and its score so much one of my all time favorites aside from the lord of the rings trilogy

but there has been a burning question that i thought about some days ago 

so when cooper goes into the black hole and saves humanity many years passed for the people on earth and murph was on her deathbed meaning at least  years passed how would time have passed for amelia and why was she still young when cooper went for her

shouldnt time have passed for her as well considering cooper realistically passed an unknown time in the tesseract 

thank you for your awesome knowledge",0.9505,1,1
"one of nolan‚Äôs ironic twists‚Ä¶

felt compelled to do another th anniversary appreciation post‚Ä¶

top early in the film professor brand tells cooper ‚Äúsomething sent you here they chose you‚Äù here we‚Äôre led to believe that those responsible for the wormhole and gravitational anomalies ‚Äúchose‚Äù cooper to save the remaining people on earth

middle cooper tells murph ‚Äúthey chose me murph they chose me you‚Äôre the one who led me to ‚Äòem‚Äù here cooper emphasizes to murph and to the audience that he has been chosen by the ‚Äúthey‚Äù behind the gravitational anomalies at their farm the nasa dust coordinates in binary the fallen books the corrupted navigation system in the indian surveillance drone and compass interference in the harvester and automated farm machines 

bottom after realizing that he and tars brought themselves to this moment to be the bridge and messengers between the fifthdimension and our thirddimensional world cooper then communicates via backwardintime gravitational forces by manipulating the world tube dust lines sending his younger self and murph the coordinates to nasa in binary it‚Äôs here where it dawns on cooper and the audience that it was his future self who led his younger self to nasa a ‚Äúcausal loop‚Äù that has always existed ironically cooper also realizes that the bulk beings didn‚Äôt choose him after all cooper while looking into the room with falling dust delightedly says to tars ‚Äúi thought they chose me but they didn‚Äôt choose me they chose her‚Ä¶to save the world‚Äù

this is another instance of nolan brilliantly employing ‚Äúsituational irony‚Äù into the narrative for the majority of the film we are led to believe that cooper was chosen by the bulk beings of the future to save the world both professor brand and younger cooper reinforce this but in a surprising ironic twist after cooper enters the tesseract he realizes the bulk beings actually chose murph to save the world  not him further he discovers what his and tars‚Äôs role is  to be the bridge between dimensions and to communicate  to send a message the quantum data to murph by exerting gravitational forces across spacetime so she can solve the problem of gravity and save the remaining people on earth",0.9813,1,1

"new rule no photos or videos from theatrical screenings

 hey everyone

with interstellar‚Äôs thanniversary rerelease in theaters i‚Äôve seen a surge of excitement from the community it‚Äôs incredible to see so many people revisiting this masterpiece on the big screen as it was meant to be experienced however i‚Äôve also noticed an increase in posts showing photos and videos taken during theatrical screenings

effective immediately i am banning all posts containing images or videos taken inside the theater during a screening

 why this rule

respect for the cinematic experience interstellar was designed for the big screen and part of its magic is in the immersion taking photos or videos during a screening disrupts that experience for others

 why am i adding this rule now

during the first rerelease i didn‚Äôt enforce this rule because it was just temporary event lasting only a week however with interstellar‚Äôs extended theatrical run and its return in multiple countries it‚Äôs clear that rereleases are becoming more frequent given this trend i expect more showings in the future and i want to establish a clear standard now by setting this rule i‚Äôm ensuring that our community continues to respect the theatrical experience and the integrity of the film for all future screenings

"interstellar may be perfect

i recently watched interstellar with my girlfriend in the theaters and i realised the movie is even better than i had previously known it to be
one of the flaws that come up for this movie is the anne hathaway scene where she says

love is the one thing were
capable of perceiving that
transcends dimensions of time
and space 

and often i have seen people
criticize this scene because it feels like anne hathaway is spelling out the message of the film breaking the show dont tell rule however im here to argue that interstellar doesnt do that and that this take and interpretation subjective as cinema is is in my opinion wrong
if im not mistaken the context of the scene is that
brand rom and coop have very little fuel due to the fiasco on millers planet so they have to
choose between dr mann or wolf edmunds 

coop is holding the debate and as scientists they are only allowing scientific and objective reasons to chart to either destinations dr brand loves wolf edmunds and besides that she has no objective or real reason to vouch for wolfs planet so she makes love sound all scientific and objective with the love transcends all barriers of space and dimension quote

its a human being whos hit by the possibility of death her own ailing father the death of a teammate on millers planet and the fact that due to relativity dr miller died minutes before they arrived even though she left years ago which means if they hurry amelia might get to see wolf
once again

she is desperately making a case for wolf edmunds planet and making love sound all
scientific and objective so she can convince rom and coop to let her see edmunds once more
before she or he die in this distant galaxy

this makes this scene one of the best scenes in the movie instead of the worst one",0.6912,1,1

going to post this here since their site wont even load right now for me lmao

dear developers

as someone who has had this game for a year and a half bought eight copies for myself friends and family and has been so unbelievably hyped for this game i suggest you go and read the reviews section of your game on steam a year ago i think i recall it being positive and now its mixed yes you know why because in all honesty no hate or insults implied this is the same game it was a year ago one new map and a hunger games type game mode was refreshing but after  hours of playing youve seen it all you improved the sounds the animations and fixed the numbers bugs that were around yes and thank you but all those give are momentary moments of glee this game is transitioning into a war game like csgo insurgency or battlefield and is hardly the intense strategically oriented and team based game you continuously make it out to be i think myself and most of your players are sick of seeing all these hot fixes that add nothing new to the game you guys need to make a cup of coffee pop some popcorn and sit down around a pc and read every review thats negative because most of them make sense 

you guys are focusing too much on the tiny nitty gritty bits of game making that is ruining it for many of your players we want better guns we want more stealth oriented maps more levels that actually force us to watch each others backs and keep a level of tense atmosphere the neurogen incident was so unbelievably fun the first time but thats it the first time maybe it lasted a week a month several months for some people but it damn well wont last us much longer the neurogen incident is the embodiment of everything you make this game out to be and we want more of those kinds of maps guys 

im no game developer but i know that switching game engines will also delay the update process seriously i think most gamers value mechanics over graphics some of the best games right now have half the graphics newer but less popular games do counterstrike is  year olds and then some and the newest edition is hardly a graphical improvement from source yet its steams most purchased game halflife the beloved masterpiece of valve has god awful graphics and is still played today star wars knights of the old republic has horrid graphics but its considered one of the best rpg games made and still has a decent player base for such an old game mechanics over graphics will always make a game better please straighten out your priorities with this game weve had the same weapons for a year with some minor tweaks the same combat style more or less we need updates on these aspects and you guys have to deliver

also while i have zero knowledge on the financial status of im i am pretty damn sure you guys have been well funded for  and considering you dont have that many servers or sea servers it seems i think your funds are mostly intact of course there are aspects i dont know about but more or less this game is earning that fact will stop if you guys dont pick up the pace im is currently less playable than a game like unturned being developed by one person who initially most likely earned less than im due to it being a free game again a game where graphics are trumped by mechanics please im more mechanics are long overdue for im 


overall i hope you guys havent wasted the money of the thousands of people who have supported you im not mad just disappointed that such a great game concept looks like itll never be finished i pray and hope you boys prove me wrong because i do wanna see im as a finished polished game someday

"why does my trade station make little to no money

im playing the uncharted space universe and have become the most powerful faction my main source of income are a refinery and a jewellery factory in androla now with about mil in the bank i decided to eradicate lambda from existence and build my own trade station in beta pindola theres plenty of traffic but it buys way more than it sells from time to time it sells some stuff for about k to seemingly nowhere it doesnt show a faction in the transaction have i done anything wrong jewellery and plasma rifles are piling up in the cargo hold and im forced to sell them manually for profit but this cant really be the use of the trade station right",-0.5933,-1,-1

"interstellar pilot mod  released  unofficial

 the ip v rebalance mod features the following

 performance improvements for low end devices which will aid tremendously in stability causing less crashes while playing large sectors  space fog has been completely disabled as well as the glob wormholes
 sandbox universe allows to create     or  sector count for custom universe play
 sector sizes have been increased to k units this makes for a much better space feeling while playing in a sector as well as it makes for a more tactical gameplay to fortify a players stronghold within a sector
 all ships  stations have been rescaled
 all ships have been rebalanced
 all stations have increased hulls and cargo
 all weapons have been rebalanced
 all shields capacitors engines  generators have been rebalanced
 stations can now equip larger generators capacitors and shields
 all nonessential bays are opened essential bays are bays required for the ship to function as well as for special orders to take place such as mining orders  passenger transport orders
 all artillery are longranged weapons and require a minimum firing distance to use  this creates a more tactical style of gameplay
 lasers now miss no more laser spamming from the npcs or the player just to win  a fighter can now outmaneuver lasers and actually dogfight  playing on full zoom in a fighter makes the game very immersive
 scratch cards give rewards this is for the nongodmode players so they can use it as a cheat for quick and easy credits
 fixed the issue where npcs would outfit their ships  stations with cloaks  basically the cloaking device is set back to its own unique bay and only the x variants will be able to properly use it as they should be only for the x variants  all other variants will just have a free extra open bay if the ship came preloaded with a cloak it might be there but it will not allow to be readded if sold to nonx variants
 satellite scan range has been increased where  single satellite is enough to scan the entire sector  the hull has been increased as well
 description text information screens have been updated so weapons will read their minimum  maximum firing ranges
 all coming soon scenarios have been unlocked now a player can enjoy the developers scenarios as they are fully accesible to play
 all new orion mesh dubbed the broadsword no more clunky models ingame
 brand new laser v the most powerful of all weapons with longreload time  only available for overlord magnus  stations unless using the ingame cheat menu can equip on any ship
 mission payouts have been rebalance
 might be forgetting what else changed  but thats all can remember

have fun and hope the mod is enjoyed by the community

cheers

yes my tactic is a bit of exotic but it works all the time

 start with a hornet do some trading or jobs so you can hire a little fleet of other small ships then raid merchantsüòä

 with the money you get buy a little hornet fleet with them you can raid more and and more for more profit if you want more support buy some shuttles and start your own cup company i works pretty good

 with a small raiding fleet and a small economy fleet you can star to militarise your faction i buy usually  or  overlords
my tactic to conquer a systemdymapa  is rush the enemy with hornets and destroy them with long range artillery support from my overlords it works pretty good because i dont got the money for stations but for more big ships i buy a few magnus x for trading because of the great trading space you gain a big profitüíµ

so came across this site along my journey and was recommended to check out the blends this was exactly what i was searching for herbal blends to aid my daily life exercising dieting meditating etc etc as i believe unfortunately we are unable to get all the goodness from foods alone in this day in age

¬†i am a real person not an ai bot or similar i am not perfect and do go through my fair share of struggles this is a true review and testimonial

¬†i have ordered a few times but one of my last orders was in april    i stocked up for the year the blends are mixed with my morning coffee and not only does the caffeine wake me up but the herbal blends also fire up the correct receptors and i have no brain fog at all i am able to focus in and get on with my day at work no stopping fir umming and rrring i am straight there and straight up with the answers my brain loves the stuff

¬†not only for my brain but also for my body my body feels good and can feel my digestion is a lot better once the digestion was sorted it helped me in other areas of my life i am not as tired during the day no more afternoon naps i also have enough energy to hit the gym in a fasted state

¬†all my blends are consumed in the morning whilst in a fasted state and i take with coffee you can take it with matcha tea as well if you like

¬†on another note i also tried a newer blend rewire i ordered this initially to aid me wean of certain substances which i should not have been taking not only did it help with my cravings i felt it also helped me sleep at night which was always an issue in the past when trying to quit i finished the pack and never felt better i wish i found these blends a decade ago

¬†i highly recommend trying some of the blends have a look on the website there will something for everyone we do not get the nutrients in the foods as we did  years ago and with ultra processed foods which has swamped our markets everything little bit helps and we should all find something to aid our daily living along with the right diet and exercise

¬†give these guys a go you wont regret it i have ordered several times and will continue to order into my old age",0.9901,1,1

i just spontaneously rewatched this masterpiece not for the last time and among all the thoughts swirling in my head i noticed theres a maybe not so subtle foil created early on between romilly and mann ive commented on this before but i never realized to what degree it was set up and wanted to make a post

from the beginning were told mann is the best of humanity etc  even before he appears on screen you get the feeling hes charismatic a natural leader just from how everyone talks about him conversely romilly is set up as quirky kind of a nerd they make a point of him showing weakness early on both physically in getting motion sickness and mentally when cooper reassures him with the yachtsman analogy 

yet when they are similarly tested doomed to never interact with another human for the rest of their lives so far as they know romilly handles it astoundingly well keeping up with his research and just generally staying level his reaction to them returning was somber but he didnt break down or become anywhere near as unstable as mann
to be fair i think mann is unfairly maligned  truly few of us who judge him have probably ever been or ever will be tested like he was but thats a different discussion",0.919,1,1

"nothing about the plot makes sense

the initial problem is blight earth is becoming uninhabitable due to an unstoppable fungibacteriawhatever outcompeting plants for nitrogen essentially solution find another habitable planet good so far but then it goes off the rails every planet they go to is worse than earth soil is alive and these planets are all dead so you need to bring your own soil which means you need to somehow remove the blight without killing the good bacteria which has nothing whatsoever to do with space travel if you have the ability to do that then you can just build a sealed agricultural environment on earth who cares if theres a planet with water through the wormhole we have plenty of water here already

but it gets worse after jumping from mcguffin to mcguffin in the form of vaguelydefined data and seriously why risk your life to get the data on millers planet how much proof do you need that you cant live there cooper goes for the real important data in the black hole with it humanity gains mastery over gravity hooray now they can colonize the ice planet through the wormhole exceptthey immediately prove they dont need to it turns out they could build perfectly selfcontained selfsufficient biomes they use the gravity mcguffin to move them to orbit near saturn but that was just for show once theyre able to create working biodomes the problem that kicked off the movie is solved furthermore once the gravity data is sent there is no need to go through the wormhole again since we now have access to the entire solar system of resources theres nothing in the gargantua system that we cant get more easily from the sol system

i dont mind the liberties taken with science but this movie is all over the place with the actual point of the plot somebody says we need to get x to do y and thats that we cant ask any further questions in the end cooper gets the data so humanity is saved the mechanics of it are handwaved away humans were on the brink but because of one singular scientific breakthrough they now live in a technoutopia the earth was screwed because it was going to be lifeless soon but now that weve reached the lifeless orbit of saturn everything is fine as if to drive home the point that they didnt care about worldbuilding beyond what it allows them to do visually cooper station is rotating to produce gravity even though we just mastered gravity dont ask questions oneill cylinders are cool

"ship building thoughts

hello i am a relative noob i have had interstellar rift for a little over half a year and have played around with it here and there but recently i have been getting more into it one of the things that keeps drawing me in is ship building so i wanted to spark a discussion about ship building a few questions i want to reach out and ask

 what speed range do you generally try to keep your ships in i personally like to make sure my builds can stay between    ms depending on the style of ship im building i personally never like my ships being rated slower than  ms

 do you draft out your designs before you build them or do you prefer to go with the flow i tend to draft my designs deck by deck in a graphing paper notebook before i build them this has helped me better understand the editor as well

 what primary sources of power do you use for most of your ships i struggled with this for a while and recently started strapping the huge hydrogen generators on my ships because the small generators and the solar panels dont seem to produce enough power to be worth it

 how to external design all my ships look like blobs unintentionally of course but i wanted to know if you guys follow any design philosophies do your ships have a common design theme or concept when looked at from the outside

 this is more of a question of technical efficiency rather than preference but is it worth putting the huge engines that you can place from systems i only built  ship using these engines and they didnt seem to be that good i much prefer the engines you can place from exterior mode",0.9854,1,1

"a nightmare of a battle

so after acquiringstealing magnuses from npc factionand and selling them i looked around for a pirate stations to exterminatei found an isolated station with three laser iii and one laser v turrets
after some scouting with a cloaked hornet i found out four fighters that after decloacking bait them into the rest of my fleet a magnusa two flyera and two thundera happy with the situation i got back at the helm of my magnus and this is where think start going bad my hornetx is destroyed in the opening salvo of the battle surprised and concerned i take a look at the sector map and there is not four not five nor seven but a dozen fighters

i immediately start firing my guns at them but after missiles and mines exploding all around me my shield take some damages but are still holding the same happens to my fighters but some of their shields are nearly downs and one of the thunder got some hull damages trying to resolve the shields problem i start salvaging the battlefield waiting for my shield to recharge but the pirate werent done yet they started sending small waves of fighter not enough to do real damage but enough to make my shield recharge impossible

and then i make my second error i trusted the autopilot which following is programming started not to head back to my base but decided to engage the turrets at very close range before i can react one of the three laser iii turrets is dead grabbing the opportunity is redirected the shots towards the laser v turret and started throwing everything i had salvo after salvo of laser and rockets bring the turret down and started heading back to my base myself but not before another wave of fighter got send my way those fighter broke my shield and begins firing directly into the hull
i went away sure of myself and get back the with my tail between my legs but i will come back stronger and this time will grab victory from my enemy

"installed this a week ago might be best mobile game ive ever played

i picked up this game a week or two ago  i am absolutely blown away by how much this game brings to the table

sure the game is pretty basic and simple just a space adventurelight action mobile game  but the way it goes about doing it is so well done  its a shame it was abandoned this game is truly amazing 

each sector just has a different mood  gatopea has a big boom industrial feel and places like solace or hellemus have the feeling of isolated gloomy bastions 

you have the feeling you are the captian of your own humble ship  the world is huge and you genuinely feel like you are making progress as you gain power wealth and make alliances 

the ships are detailed for such a simple game and it forces you to use your credits wisely on specific upgrades the combat requires timing and the correct craft  the economy feels alive and everything depends on one another

however its also the small details you can communicate to ai as you travel about the galaxy you can scavenge recent battle sites and sell the scraps at a refinery  you can group up ships and send them off to run errands for you

sure other games are more nostalgic some are more complex some have better graphics and player input  but this game feels so alive and truly hits different

   you cant buy mining laser and adv mining laser anymore or they just changed the buying shop it was on refinery before this is bad for me haulerh miner is actually really good

 interface layout
   the cargo trade and equipment screen is much neater and easier to navigate pretty good especially if you have something specific to buy and dont want to waste time pressing arrow buttons to look at every cargo

 mercenary ai
   a nice addition helps for station attacks pretty cheap too only if there were more of them

hey everyone

so chip asked me to make a plugin for his reaper server that cleaned up all ships within  meters of the starter stations

i figured others may take interest in this plugin as well i know that a lot of servers such as ourmind have a policy to just destroy ships that are left unattended and offline around spawn hopefully this will make things easier for both the user and the admin d

what it does is every  hours configurable it checks each ship within  meters configurable of each starter station to see if that ship is a unoccupied and b if the owner is offline if both are true it stores the ship in that starter stations vault

the plugin works but it still needs quite a lot of testing so i would recommend holding off on using it until chip and i can test it out a little bit more  but it seems to work from initial testing

you can check it out plus the source code on the augtrix website

interstellar blends have been a transformative addition to my familys daily routine as a real consumer since  with a last order number of  from may  i have experienced significant personal benefits since incorporating these blends into our lives personally i have lost a substantial amount of weight with thermo which has not only improved my physical health but also boosted my overall confidence the blends autonomous and luteolin have been instrumental in helping me focus and maintain the energy and cognitive focus needed during the entirety of my doctorate program their impact has extended beyond just me proving beneficial for my entire family in various ways

my husband has also seen remarkable improvements in his health since using interstellar blends he has successfully lost weight with thermo as well as autophagy and more importantly managed to combat the constant pain caused by inflammation with ascendance he has healed his stomach ulcers with helico as well he takes shilajit daily as he is super active and needs his electrolytes replenished quickly additionally he has gained better control over his temper thanks to rewire leading to a more harmonious household our son who began using the blends to enhance his cognitive abilities has seen incredible results at just  years old he was able to start college a milestone we attribute largely to the benefits of also taking autonomous and luteolin blends he uses peel and spice when he goes overboard at the gym and never feels sore

the benefits of interstellar blends do not stop there my yearold grandmother uses throm to dissolve a blood clot and lung power for her copd showcasing their wideranging efficacy we all rely on these blends for overall wellness and as a preventive measure against common illnesses in times of sickness victorious blend has been our goto remedy to combat germs and promote faster recovery additionally we all take trinity to keep our mental health in top shape ensuring we stay balanced and mentally resilient our collective experience with interstellar blends has been overwhelmingly positive and we wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone seeking natural effective solutions for health and wellness",0.998,1,1

"thoughts about the game

game has potential  i really enjoyed playing it  a few of my thoughts that might make the game more enjoyable for others

 the ais still need tweaking i feel like  i see them flying a lot of empty legs both to and from different planets  i look at the income chart for all the companies and i noticed that all the ais at some point will make this same crash and burn  theyll do nothing for longest while then buy  ships fly them empty and then go away for awhile

the thing that bothered me the most was the reputation system  i like the idea of it but in practice it seems like more of a headache  i think it may need some tweaking so that it is less senstive to changes  i feel like i gear up to start serving a planet and by the time i have the resources to actually make a difference my reputation is almost zero and i cant  develope the planet at all  this was a huge headache in my first real play through as my ability to leave the starting system was completely halted becuase my reputaion with the only plane that could get me out of system was zero  now i realize thats mostly my fault but once it reached zero i could not raise and keep it high enough to really do anything with the planet  this basically limited me to the starting system

some things that came to my mind as i was playing that might make things more interesting
get politics invovled airlines get very political when it comes to slot space at airports maybe not every planet can sustain a massive space port
board room disputes would be a cool and different way to go this can also lead into mergers acquisitions and hostile takeovers
maybe try to add a terrain like feature  maybe strange anomolies that arent understood block certain routes in space maybe even a black hole that you have to navigate around
a rocket capable of interstellar travel would be pretty handy dont know if i never made it that far in the game but there were moments that would have been nice to have
if you sell a ship dont just delete the cargo but have it off loaded on the planet it is at
just like how you can schedule a ship to be sold do the same with the change chargo loadout function",0.9873,1,1

i think this squeamishness on his part is actually somewhat tied to his conscience part of his inability to watch coop die is his own overwhelming instinct to save him this tiny shred of humanity left inside mann actually ends up saving the crew and humanity and killing mann in the process as his inability to watch or even listen to coop die precluded his clean escape",-0.9944,-1,-1

audio log  ruben snyder 

attention to all crew some of our benefactors from the neurogen pharma corporation are to use this facility on the th of this month the purpose of this meeting is to increase their financial support to the vital work were developing here i here request that all service and maintenance personnel to perform a full check on the stations main systems and ready uniform in pristine condition to the research teams please provide updated reports on your work as soon as possible for presentation and evaluation

audio log  sarah magellan 

its always the same thing doesnt matter whether your still in college or at top level private company something always goes missing honestly how does doctor barbero expect me to continue work when the supplies keep going missing

audio log  leo stark 

doctor sarah was right someone is accessing the storage room taking supplies without signing them off whoever it is only old time stamps left i cant identify anything else ill ask hank choo to check on this and see if anyone altered the access mechanism but im still waiting for his report i should notify mr snyder about this

audio log  hank choo 

leo stark asked me to check on the access door to the storage room apparently someone has been accessing it without leaving any record of whos access card was used the access mechanism is working fine and the manual override hasnt been used as far as i can tell given the circumstances i think someone got their hands on a skeleton key but the only people able to produce one would be me david calru and snyder still not sure if i should report this back to mr lee or mr snyder

audio log  william barbero 

snyder just came around asking about the missing supplies from storage had to tell him about dr magellans latest break through and about the replication of the results he became rather interested in my own side experiments asking me to continue and not to worry about docs investigation apparently hes contacting the ito defense department are interested in this kind of research which means funding is no longer an issue even if neurogen pulls the plug on us

audio log  leo stark 

just finished reading hanks and choos report he cant find anything wrong with the access mechanism to the storage area so i got no other option but to keep a close eye on this to make matters worse when i mentioned this event to snyder he said if i couldnt find anything else i should just let it die i cant do thatm i have an obligation to these people there safety is my responsibility if theres any foul play and it endangers the crew ill be crucified

audio log  hank choo 

talking to mr snyder about the storage situation seemed to expedite our next delivery neurogen headquarters is sending a coald mission  days ahead of schedule ill have to send a team to clear the hangar bay for the extra supply were getting but at least kimmie will have a birthday gift in time this year instead of having to wait for the usual delivery date despite all the hassle theres a silver lining i really hope she likes it i miss my little girl

audio log  sarah magellan 

finally some progress the subject has shown improvement in the profita test and sensorial memory after only  weeks of being administrated anti compound on a daily basis most of the subjects also have shown intermittent explosive disorder a behavioral disorder characterized by extreme expression of anger often to the point of a controlled rage it is yet unclear if it the result of the lesions in the prefrontal cortex caused by the alzheimers or if it is a side effect of the drug well have to wait for the autopsy to make sure

audio log  william barbero 

dr magellans latest results are quite promising however she did forget to mention some rather interesting side effects on a small percentage of the test sample some of the subjects exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to pain increased aggressiveness and intermittent explosive disorder as reported previously by dr magellan on a special note the sample in the sample takes that aggression to rather extreme perpicks i cobbled off the subjects forged channer to the point of inflicting lethal injuries on one another without stopping or diminishing the ferocity of the attacks

audio log  ellen weaver 

ive had to deal with more complaints than usual this week because of the communication restrictions adrub is correct in the pass of them after our arrangement with the ito we must be very careful with the information we let slip to the outside as these sent board of investors have had the opportunity to weight in on the matter im sure we agree on rupert decision to let doctor barberos pursue his new avenue of research besides itll surely provide much better profit we achieve by trading the sith key

audio log  sarah magellan 

dr barbero has been moody as of late since my last breakthrough hes been so focused on his lab he barely takes a rest im concern hell soon enough have a nervous breakdown i dont get it why hes acting like this i mean i know the investor meeting is in a couple of days and the progress weve had is tremendous im sure neurogen will continue to fund us there is no need for this

audio log  william barbero 

ive been replication dr magellans experiment and finally identified and isolated neurogenic prenos for the decreased sensitivity to pain aggressiveness and reminiscences to shoot one way to control this was to include an energy plutonic agent that increases sensibility to suggestion the aggression is still there but the subjects can be more easily controlled by a third party also aerial dispersion of modified viral agent has proven to be just as effective as in its original formation and much simpler to apply just need to place samples on a closed environment and its ready

audio log  miki byen 

as usual this time of year i rounded up all of the stations personnel including the patients and conducted the mandatory medical check up still how i hate it when people call me dr bennerd its like the running joke when its time to draw some blood really how difficult is it to say dr miki byen anyway the first lab works are complete and theres a potentially alarming result dr barberos blood work is very similar to one of the patient dakota dakoo one of the volunteers from ito military fortunately i wont be able to report this to headquarters until communications are restored while i notified snyder about it hopefully hell take some safety measures

audio log  sarah magellan 

i just had to go and see snyder willia uhhh dr barberos behavior of late is starting to really concern me he no longer lets his research assistant in the lab and shuts anyone who even passes by i hope snyder can talk him into taking sometime off he really needs it

audio log  william barbero 

after all our staunt to bring it to the neurogen research department that whiny little bitch went over my back to rupert whats it to her if im spending too much time in my lab its my damn work she wouldnt be so damn pinulated if i showed her my own progress long sigh maybe i should

random audio log  sarah magellan 

dr barbero keeps pushing hard on our work i dont understand why hes rushing this i keep getting the same results and the equipment degrades faster i wonder if the investor meeting in a few days has anything to do with it either way david is going to have to hurry back to the lab at least with rupert supporting us we wont have to wait for long

random audio log  david cutler 

im really starting to loose my patience with this women i know bloody well that her work is important but other people need their equipment as well if it wasnt for snyder pushing her to the top of the pile the other labs would be performing much better atleast shes much easier than doctor barberos as of late that man is becoming quite stressful to be around hes spending too much time in the lab

random audio log  hank choo 

another one of those seminars i bet cutler has been hating on the new research assistant awww that cute little redhead i mean that guy is good at what he does but damn he caught a horna soon enough either snyder or neurogen is going to have him put in his own little cage come on little ape come on good boy hahahahaha what a sight",0.9897,1,1

why does the cloaking mechanism of interstellar pilot  automatically uncloacks ships when they take damage while they are on the process of cloacking ive only observed this on small cloak devices no matter what level it is it still happens i find it devastating when im on a fight and suddenly the enemy decided to target lock and surround me i pop it my level  version of the small cloak device that also has  damage reduction while cloakinguncloaking in hopes of switching their targets on one of my other ships but as i do so with their weapons still firing at me my ship automatically uncloaks itself while playing the uncloak sound in the process my hull health is now down to orange much faster than if i havent cloak in the first place anyone else experience this i dont know if it is the same case on the cloaks used for capital ships as i dont typically equip them with one

the st game of interstellar pilot does not do this as far as i can tell dont get me started on detectable cloaked ships as long as you are within  units from them or so is the nerf of the cloaking system on this nd game that bad state your opinion as well in the comments down below thanks for reading have a great day pilots",-0.3285,-1,-1

what sets this blend apart is how it provides sustained energy and stamina even during extended periods without food normally by day three or four fatigue starts to creep in making it challenging to stay focused and energized but with ecstatic i felt a clear steady flow of energy that kept me going never feeling like i was about to hit a wall or collapse from exhaustion

this blend not only fuels my body but also sharpens my mental clarity allowing me to maintain productivity and focus throughout my fast i found myself thinking clearer feeling more present and even having an enhanced sense of wellbeing all without the usual brain fog that accompanies prolonged fasting

for anyone looking to explore the transformative power of extended fasting while maintaining optimal energy levels and mental acuity interstellar blend ecstatic is the key it‚Äôs more than just a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolutionary tool for anyone looking to push their limits and achieve a new state of wellness highly recommended",0.9903,1,1

i am making a history of the interstellar pilot universe  this is volume one tell me what you think

 

in  a group of astronauts were manning a small orbital station circling around titan  this station was a joint project conducted between the united american federation modern usa and the north african republic modern egypt  on routine maintenance calls they spotted a faint strange object a few miles away

xb

it glowed a bright green

xb

scientists had not seen anything like this before although they knew fairly well that it was a wormhole  the very thought of this shook civilization to its core  they knew they had to test it but were not ready to do it on humans  they designed a few simple drones that would get in and get out of the wormhole  these missions were a success but they returned with high levels of radiation and with odd new chemicals attached to them

they decided to build a craft with humans inside of it  for  years they used the best available technologies and every government in the sol system were cooperating on a common goal  the day came and the  brave astronauts stepped inside the vulcan

the leap into the wormhole was only described by the pilots as a green tunnel obscuring your entire vision  it was eerie and mind numbing  but according to them it was worth it  they ventured into a whole new galaxy barraged with a onslaught of new experiences around them all from the saftey of their own little ship

xb

they didnt see the meteor coming

xb

unfortunately most of the radio signals did not make it in time but the temperature and ionizers shifted dramatically  they knew there was something on the other side  these scientists dedicated to their craft and their respective nations worked hard to make this new hope possible

the vulcan managed to return successfully  they were anointed as heroes to mankind and given millions of credits  most importantly they set a basis of knowledge to allow more ships to venture in

eventually a commercial model of the vulcan was made now known as the rangera  cheap to make and easy to operate everyone in the sol system used them

over the next few decades a number of small colonies were made by different nations  they united themselves under one common name

httpspreviewredditqorhtdsfepngwidthformatpngautowebpseebdccccdcebbcdcda

this film has something at its emotional center the relationship between a father with his daughter but cooper and murph cooper arent the only fatherdaughter pair on this story there is also dr brand and his daughter amelia brand

from dr brand point of view he was sending his daughter to a place where she got a chance to be part of the new colony of course his daughter ends up finding out but only because dr cooper told dr brands daughter the truth he didnt want to tell his daughter the world was ending im not saying he was right by the way but i can think he was wrong and empathize at the same time

this is a way for christopher nolan to explore the fatherdaughter dynamic from two angles

 the father that went far away to save his daughter world while she becomes a scientist working on the research

 the hopeless father doing the research who sent his own daughter away to save her from what he saw as a dying world

on  
both men are driven by love but they take a different approach in their hope and despair 

this is all i got to say for now about

"did cooper really save humanity

let the flames begin maybe

i think the ending of interestellar is regularly misread  while theres a lot of things that we dont know about black holes we do know that the forces at play would not allow a human to exist and remain organically functional  it would kill us

matt damons character dr mann who never discusses his own family who knows if he even has one talks with cooper about your children being the last thing that you see before you die  i think this is exactly what happens as cooper is sucked into gargantua  just as hes dying he imagines a world where he can communicate with the child he left behind and basically orphaned to save her and others  the reality is that happy endings dont always actually happen despite what we want

the only thing that imho happened was that dr brand made it to the final world the one she was trying to get to the entire time and starts a new colony of humans which is where cooper also wishes he could have gone after he realizes that he barely knows the daughter that he orphaned  she has her own life and pushes him to go find the life he knows better",0.1791,1,1

"faq millers world spoilers

on several forums ive seen moviegoers poking  prodding at plot holes and science errors in interstellar while some are legitimate criticisms the vast majority have fairly simple explanations in this post i hope to correct some misconceptions about millers world which seems to be getting the brunt of the criticism the following is based on information provided in chapter  of kip thornes the science of interstellar

general premise millers world is a roughly earthsize planet orbiting the supermassive black hole gargantua the planet orbits so close that time passes x slower on its surface compared to the outside universe due to gravitational time dilation the surface is covered in a global ocean and any given point is inundated by skyscrapersize waves every hour or so local time 

q why doesnt the planet get sucked into the black hole if its so close

a contrary to popular belief it is perfectly possible to safely orbit a black hole only when an object gets extremely close roughly when distance to the event horizon  diameter of the event horizon does the extreme curvature of spacetime prevent stable orbits from existing but millers world is extremely close to gargantua so whats holding it there while gargantua does have extreme gravity another property of the singularity can help counteract it in some cases ‚Äì its spin when enough mass spins fast enough it can actually ‚Äúdrag‚Äù the spacetime around it in a spinning motion gargantua is  million times heavier than the sun and spins at  of lightspeed x the maximum possible spin so this effect is significant it turns out when you run the math that there is an orbit just outside the event horizon where gravity and centrifugal effects balance out and miller‚Äôs world can reside the orbit is also stable any perturbation pushing the planet slightly closer or further away will cause an opposing reaction force keeping the planet in its orbit 

q wouldnt the planet be torn to shreds from intense tidal forces

a this might stem from a misconception of what tidal forces actually are right now as you‚Äôre sitting in front of your computer your feet are slightly closer to earth‚Äôs center than your head that means there‚Äôs actually a difference in gravity between the two which manifests as a force working to stretch you vertically ‚Äì a tidal force of course earth‚Äôs gravity is weak enough that you‚Äôll never actually notice but go near a black hole with much more intense gravity and the effect can be very significant enough to rip your body apart before you get anywhere near the event horizon so how does miller‚Äôs world stay in one piece if it‚Äôs so close counterintuitively it‚Äôs because gargantua is so massive tidal forces around a black hole decrease as the black hole gets larger remember a tidal force comes about because gravity has a different strength on two sides of an object gargantua‚Äôs event horizon is as wide as earth‚Äôs orbit around the sun compared to that the width of miller‚Äôs world is absolutely puny when you run the math you find that the tidal forces experienced by miller‚Äôs world would be enough to slightly deform the planet into an eggshape but not enough to rip it apart it‚Äôll stay in one piece

q why do clocks tick slower there and why did the crew age slower

a one of the consequences of special  general relativity is that time and space are not absolute independent things they are intertwined into one d entity ‚Äì spacetime ‚Äì and can be stretched and warped the warping of time is referred to as ‚Äútime dilation‚Äù and can occur when a two objects are travelling incredibly fast relative to each other andor b an object is in an extreme gravity field both of these effects noticeably affect miller‚Äôs world it‚Äôs zipping around gargantua at nearly  lightspeed in its orbit and is very deep in the black hole‚Äôs extreme gravity well the cumulative effect of these two facts is that time itself runs slower on miller‚Äôs world relative to the rest of the universe  hour on the planet equals  years on earth such extreme dilation is possible due to gargantua‚Äôs immense mass and proportionally immense gravity note that this isn‚Äôt just something that affects clocks it affects any physical process that involves time including all the molecular interactions in your body that keep you alive and cause you to age literally everything runs slower on the planet ‚Äì but you wouldn‚Äôt notice because your thoughts and cognitive processes would have slowed by the same amount to you the outside universe would be running fast and to anyone far away from the black hole they would see you running in slow motion 

q whats making those waves

a there are a few theories making the rounds what follows is kip thorne‚Äôs theory which i personally think explains them best recall that although they don‚Äôt rip it apart tidal forces from gargantua are enough to distort miller‚Äôs world into more of an eggshape than a sphere due to its nowslightlyelongated shape the planet will have a preferred orientation relative to the black hole with its long axis perpendicular to the event horizon it will be tidally locked one side will always face gargantua and the other will always face away tidal forces act to maintain this stable orientation ‚Äì any slight rotation away from it will cause a reaction force acting to push it back here‚Äôs where the waves come in if miller‚Äôs world were just barely not tidally locked had a slight residual spin it would instead oscillate slightly back and forth like a pendulum around its most stable orientation these periodic oscillations would make the planetary ocean slosh back and forth and could create massive waves like those seen in the film

q how did the ranger reach the planet at all if it‚Äôs spinning around gargantua at half of lightspeed

a supermassive black holes tend to gather a lot of smaller bodies stars planets debris etc in their orbital space gargantua doesn‚Äôt just have  planets there‚Äôs loads of other stuff orbiting it cooper references this at one point when he says ‚Äúi could slingshot around that neutron star to slow down‚Äù by using carefully calculated gravitational slingshots around small highgravity objects like neutron stars and miniblackholes the ranger could have gotten from endurance‚Äôs parking orbit high above gargantua down to miller‚Äôs world without using the engines much plus since the ranger  crew will be in freefall during the slingshots they won‚Äôt feel any gforces despite the tremendous accelerations they‚Äôll be undergoing 

  

all that said there is one outright impossible thing about millers world  this image httpiimgurcomyomncfjpg from when the ranger descends to the surface gargantua is depicted as being about x larger in the planets sky than the moon is in earths sky however in order to experience the stated time dilation the planet would have to be so close to gargantua that the event horizon would fill half the sky nolan wanted to save closeup imagery of the event horizon for the climax of the film so he overrode kip thorne and instead depicted the planet as further away than it actually is

a clear sky on miller‚Äôs world would truly be a spectacular sight one half of the sky would be pitch black ‚Äì the event horizon ‚Äì and the other half would be a twisted starfield spinning ten times a second thanks to time dilation from your perspective the planet orbits gargantua in a tenth of a second along with the accretion disk forming a massive arc of light stretching across the sky

"atlantid multitool reveal method find all versions in any system

when you find an atlantid monolitham with an sclass multitoolmt or one you like

you have just landed at a am drop a save beacon on exit and create a restore point do this before you look at the am you will need to keep returning to this exact am so this save beacon is very important to keep the am located the popup podium off to the outer edge of the am is where you obtain the mt not the main part of am

first check the popup podium out for the mt do not exchange unless you want it exit covo reload the restore point at the am and check for the mt it should have changed in appearence do not exchange unless you want it exit covo

next enter your ship and fly to the nearest plantary body land exit ship reload that restore point fly back to the am and check for the mt it should have changed in appearence do not exchange unless you want it exit covo

continue to go to each other planetary body land exit your ship reload that restore point created by exiting your ship returning each time to the original am to check the new appearence you can reveal them all for that sysem or stop at your preference and claim it

typically i go from closest to farthest planetary body moons included mt versions are limited to the number of planetry bodies in the system plus  there is a maximum of  versions for any system  
  
if you did not get  versions at the am upon finding it usually means you skipped over the default mt if you go to the space station and make a restore point it should always give you the default mt appearance at the am i believe you can use your capitol ship or the anomaly this way too

once you have revealed all the mts in a system you can always go backwards to any of the planetary bodies to create the restore point needed to claim that prefered mt at the am

a prerequisite mission is required before you can find atlantid  httpsnomansskyfandomcomwikitheywhoreturnedhttpsnomansskyfandomcomwikitheywhoreturned

anyway since updating the save file was gone so i made a custom universe biggest size and started over

this is where i get the problems before i had zero issues with auto trading and now despite having all intel on all sectors every single time my single ship enters a new sector while on its way to pick up certain goods it stops and goes back to finding another trade route same thing if it runs into a ship or station and has to adjust course it stops and starts looking for a new trade route and this is so bad that last night while at work i left it running under my desk and checked on it after  hours of play and my ship had not completed a single trade it had just kept rerouting over and over again

"atlantid multitool reveal method find all versions in any system

when you find an atlantid monolitham with an sclass multitoolmt or one you like

you have just landed at a am drop a save beacon on exit and create a restore point do this before you look at the am you will need to keep returning to this exact am so this save beacon is very important to keep the am located the popup podium off to the outer edge of the am is where you obtain the mt not the main part of am

first check the popup podium out for the mt do not exchange unless you want it exit covo reload the restore point at the am and check for the mt it should have changed in appearence do not exchange unless you want it exit covo

next enter your ship and fly to the nearest plantary body land exit ship reload that restore point fly back to the am and check for the mt it should have changed in appearence do not exchange unless you want it exit covo

continue to go to each other planetary body land exit your ship reload that restore point created by exiting your ship returning each time to the original am to check the new appearence you can reveal them all for that sysem or stop at your preference and claim it

typically i go from closest to farthest planetary body moons included mt versions are limited to the number of planetry bodies in the system plus  there is a maximum of  versions for any system  
  
if you did not get  versions at the am upon finding it usually means you skipped over the default mt if you go to the space station and make a restore point it should always give you the default mt appearance at the am i believe you can use your capitol ship or the anomaly this way too

once you have revealed all the mts in a system you can always go backwards to any of the planetary bodies to create the restore point needed to claim that prefered mt at the am

a prerequisite mission is required before you can find atlantid  httpsnomansskyfandomcomwikitheywhoreturnedhttpsnomansskyfandomcomwikitheywhoreturned

i recently spent six months traveling across various countries and one of the best decisions i made was to bring along interstellar blends gainz blend longterm travel can be incredibly taxing on both body and mind‚Äîirregular sleep constant changes in time zones and unpredictable diets can all add up to leave you feeling worn out luckily gainz came to my rescue

right from the start gainz was an absolute gamechanger i felt an impressive boost in  physical energy i was amazed at how well i could bounce back the next day 

the most remarkable thing about gainz was its impact on muscle recovery and overall stamina as someone who tries to stay fit even on the road it‚Äôs usually tough to maintain consistency with workouts while traveling but gainz made it much easier my muscle soreness was significantly reduced and my energy levels remained steady which kept me motivated to get those quick workouts in whenever i had the chance

overall i can‚Äôt recommend interstellar blends and gainz enough especially for those on the move or looking for an edge in their physical performance and recovery its not just a supplement‚Äîits been an essential part of maintaining my health fitness and wellbeing throughout my travels if youre looking for something that truly delivers on its promise gainz is worth every penny",0.9908,1,1

this time we‚Äôve updated the game to the latest version of unity version  which have solved a few of our outstanding crash bugs and given us a slight performance increase on all platforms but the big ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù news is that due to the huge support we‚Äôve received on steam we‚Äôve added a few more people to the team which will help us get more beefy updates out the door sooon 

update  is planned for friday next week if everything goes according to our plans and in this update we hope to bring you a new large outdoor map staged to simulate an atmospheric evacuation zone right at the heart of a moist swamp environment we‚Äôll also be working on an initial profile implementation for your combat training stats and maybe we‚Äôll even throw in a small surprise from your subconscious 

improvements
updated game engine to unity  overall better performance 

updated team with  new old members reese and heks level designer and music composer and increased office map size 

updated game to default to fullscreen native resolution on first startup possibly fixes black screen on startup bug 

updated opengl shadow filtering so shadows on osx are just as pretty as windows

"interstellar is the spot where the venn diagram of pop culture and scifi nerds intersect

im not passing any judgement but ive been seeing a lot of questions about the film in this sub especially since the rerelease now the film definitely is worth a couple of viewings to get the finer points but i was genuinely baffled by some of the questions people ask i dont consider myself exceptionally intelligent just average im not claiming to be smarter than the people asking questions but the answers often seem obvious to me 

it got me thinking a huge film from one of the biggest directors in the business with an allstar cast and one of the best scores in film history it was bound to bring in outsiders to the genre im used to discussing scifi with fellow scifi fans and i think we all just have a legup on the common tropes and concepts of science fiction

"my favorites wowza

let me review my very favorite blends i have tried quite a few

first i started using interstellar blends over  years ago i started with the peel blend which helps with keeping blood sugars down i used a blood glucose monitor to track my morning blood fasting levels each day to see if the blend really affected my glucose sure enough a few weeks later my readings were consistently in the  range upon waking rather than  so i kept taking the peel blend i kind of began to crave it a few months later i noticed that in addition to my reduced glucose levels i was also not getting the colds and flu even when everyone else in the house got sick wow peel has remained a daily blend for me ever since

my second blend that was lifechanging was trinity this blend helps with anxiety i am truly one of those adaptable i can handle anything kind of people until i wasnt with perimenopause came some real deep anxiety and strong emotions that were rough i was crying my hisband asking what was wrong i would tearfully say i dont know i started on trinity and a week later no more tightness in the chest no more tears i went along like this for a few months and ran out of my trinity i had no clue how much it was helping until i didnt have it the crash of anxiety and sadness came back in a swoop until i could get more ordered and taken for a couple days but that is the cool thing about trinity it doesnt dull emotions or make you feel flat like some medications it just makes you feel like a regular person again i will never again let myself run out of this blend

right now i am experimenting with a few of the newer blends that help with metabolism and weight loss nrf trigliceride fatty liver and ceramide are some of the blends in the mix ive struggled with weight gain with perimenopause and decided to tackle the issue in  months i have lost  pounds and still losing the online community for interstellar blends is incredibly supportive and i am motivated to continue my weight loss journey supported by the blends
